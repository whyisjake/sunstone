		"Presenters": "John Dominic Crossan, D. Michael Quinn",
		"Description": "The tension between authority and personal conscience can be seen in the citizen's relation to political authority, the scholar's relation to academic authorities, and the believer's relation to the church. The relationship between authority and personal conscience is dialectic: the two are neither identical nor separable, and each is constantly informing the other. Dissent sometimes grows out of this tension. What examples do we have of dissent helping to build a religious community? What examples do we have of when it failed? How do we judge success or failure in these cases?"

		"Description": "Instead of focusing on the well-known places where LDS theology diverges from Christianity at large, this presentation offers a broad overview of our common Christian heritage. Every faith community develops its own vocabulary, and that vocabulary is heavily influenced by the culture it emerges from, meaning that it develops what may seem to be contradictions at first glance, but may actually be hinding commonalities."

		"Description": "The Church's history with adoption and foster care is gray area. Efforts like the Indian Placement Program and sometimes-coercive and secretive practices of LDS Social/Family Services were guided by wrong-headed ideas about the superiority of some familiesÑwhite families, wealthy families, temple-sealed familiesÑover others. Mormons who become foster parents are vulnerable to some of the same false ideas. This panel will discuss best practices for foster and foster-adopt parents by sharing personal experiences and answering audience members' questions."

		"Presenters": "Robert A. Rees",
		"Description": "Jesus said, \"As a person thinks in her heart, so is she.\" Long thought to be just a metaphor, the idea of a thinking heart is now supported by scientific findings revealing that the heart has its own nervous system with an electrical field 60 times greater in amplitude than that of the brain. It generates 5,000 times more electromagnetic energy than the brain, and that sends more information to the brain than the brain sends to the heart. What are the implications of such understanding in terms of epistemology, spiritual inquiry, and revelation?"

		"Description": "My husband and I didn't just wake up one sunny morning and say, \"Let's join a polygamist cult.\" Over time, a convergence of psychological and social factors ripened us for the picking. Insecurities played a part. So did classic, cultish appeals. So did mainstream Mormonism, not just by laying a doctrinal foundation, but by training members to tolerate cognitive dissonance, and through its own, albeit far less extreme, cultish tendencies. This presentation will examine those factors through my experiences and the work of psychologists such as Frank Sulloway."

It explores the way members with same-sex attraction have voluntarily removed themselves from the LDS community by assuming a diasporic identity, as well as how those members view themselves in regards to the Church and its doctrine. This paper argues that temporality is understood as being both static and fluid which allows church members, through ritualized acts, to move both backward and forward in time to moments of \"rupture\" and \"forever.\""

		"Description": "Many children are being born without the benefit of married parents. Remedy? Family studies economist Isabel V. Sawhill extols highly reliable LARCs (long-acting reversible contraceptives) as being pro-children, pro-life, pro-marriage, and pro-income-equality. Accordingly, why not have the federal government pay female participants enough to make implanted LARCs the norm? Despite its public interest virtures, religious leaders would probably voice opposition to such a policy, construing it as a \"license to fornicate.\" This paper presents a secondary cash incentive that would hopefully neutralize that opposition."

The printed Book of Mormon resembles the Bible, but the story of its production and provenance does not fit the biblical model.

Many of those people are now parents and grandparents. This panel will discuss the challenges of raising children in the Mormon faith, but outside the mainstream. Parents will discuss \"inoculation,\" navigating the politics of church youth programs, and balancing faith and criticism. Finally, the panel will discuss the consequences of a Sunstone upbringing.

Then, twenty-five years ago, following the publishing of Hugh Nibley's essay collection, Approaching Zion, and then an iconic \"Plotting Zion\" conference co-sponsored by Sunstone the following year, \"Zion\" seemed poised to once again rise up as a vital and energizing concept. But today, we hear much less about it. Has Zion simply become a vague thought, something we strive to practice only \"within our hearts\"?

Although they grant that the evidence for faith is incomplete, they also hold that knowledge of God is not attainable simply through empirical methods. Faith also plays a role in the Christian doctrine of salvation. How is the faith connected with knowledge related to the faith connected with works? Can faith be saved as an eternal principle vital to the pursuit of truth? Can faith save us for and in the kingdom of God?"

But a few stories have the power to launch us toward the divine by invoking sheer horror: psychological, emotional, and cognitive. Joseph Smith's polygamy is one of those storiesÑespecially for Mormons. But in order to ride this story, which will threaten at any second to buck us into a sand pit of denial or off the cliff of apostasy, we need to dismantle everything we think we know about how we can know anything."

He believed that devastation, unlike anything Americans had ever experienced, would overtake the nation. It was a principal reason for dissociating himself from Sidney Rigdon and Brigham Young and starting his own church. The paper will explain why Bickerton decided to forsake Rigdon and Young, and will show how the Civil War grounded his belief in the Book of Mormon."

		"Presenters": "Paul H. Smith",
		"Description": "Studies show that brain stimulation, or manipulation of a participant's sensory environment, can duplicate certain religious or mystical experiences. Some tout this as evidence that such states are indeed ontologically \"real,\" just not in any supernatural wayÑmerely the consequence of a \"brain hiccup\" of sorts.

		"Description": "We all have two different minds neurobiologically: One driven by the fearful, judgmental brain amygdala, and the other centered in the wise, reasonable prefrontal cortex (which connects intimately with parts creating compassion). They are different minds because they compete with each other on functional scanning: when one is activated, the other is inhibited. Amygdala overdrive causes health problems (both physical and mental), which improve with spiritual practices that activate the wise prefrontal cortex, creating wellbeing and inhibiting fear and judgmentalism. All this correlates highly with Jesus' teachings about resilience. Awareness of the differences allows choice of which mind to feed."

		"Description": "Religious ritual is strange, but there is a method to its madness. The many forms it takes, from meditation to ecstatic dance, from the solemnity of the LDS endowment to ceremonies involving psychotropic drugs, all point toward a coherent vision of who we are and how this secret is so easily obscured by our day-to-day experience. This session explores why ritual can lead participants to feel empowered with a greater sense of orientation and peace."

		"Presenters": "W. Paul Reeve",
		"Description": "Drawing upon scholarship from his recent book, Religion of a Different Color: Race and the Mormon Struggle for Whiteness, Paul Reeve explores the ways in which outside observers racialized Mormons as not white enough in the nineteenth century. Mormons responded by trying to claim whiteness for themselves, even at the expense of their own black converts. Reeve argues that it is only in viewing Mormon whiteness as a contested variable, not an assumed fact, that a new paradigm emerges for understanding Mormonism's tortured relationship with blackness."

While we recognize this can be a valuable paradigm for many, this panel will discuss some of its implications. For example, what does a heterosexual god-couple imply for same-gender couples? Would feminizing some attributes through a goddess figure impair the development of those traits in men? Does eternal gender (and associated eternal attributes) abrogate hopes for egalitarian institutions?"

While powerful in its eternal implications, many of the root ideas surrounding this doctrine are problematic to the psychological, emotional, and physical health of persons involved in the adoption triangle: adoptee, birth parents and adoptive parents. This paper identifies shame cycles specific to Mormon culture that impact adoption triangle identities and relationships; it also explores current social science theories that can aid and empower individuals, couples, and families to act in wisdom and order."

These foundational narratives were at the heart of Nephite and Lamanite hatred, trapping both communities in a cycle of violence.

However, many Mormons still practice birth control.This presentation will examine conventional and alternative birth control methods."

		"Presenters": "Seth Bryant, Miles Fuller",
		"Description": "It is difficult to respond to transgender identities from within a Mormon framework since Mormonism imbues gender with eternal significance and often conflates emerging transgender identities with sexual deviance. This presentation will illuminate the lived religion of transgender Restoration members against the backdrop of typical institutional and cultural responses. How do transgender persons generate and contest meaning and identity within the unique cultural-historical-theological matrices of the LDS Church and Community of Christ? How might Restoration churches faithfully respond?"

		"Presenters": "Alan Rock Waterman",
		"Description": "Call them what you will: \"Maverick Mormons\", \"Uncorrelated Mormons\", \"The Remnant\", \"Saints in the Wilderness\", \"Neo - Restorationists\", or even \"LDS Anarchists\" most Saints who find their spiritual nourishment outside the structure of the LDS Church have two common characteristics: 1.) A devotion to Christ and the principles of the Restoration, and 2.) A belief that contemporary Church leaders no longer receive revelation and are therefore spiritually irrelevant to the Church. As their ranks swell, how might these unfaithful faithful affect the future of the Church?"

This paper argues that these traits actually evolved over time to help the individual view his or her tribe and benevolent activity in it as more desirable than individual selfishness."

		"Presenters": "Gina Colvin, Joanna Brooks",
		"Description": "Notwithstanding its immense cross-cultural missionary workforce that spans the world, Mormonism still behaves like a white, conservative, American, patriarchal religion, dragging around American cultural trappings, expectations, and processes wherever it goes. Though much has been said about American imperialism, little has been said about American religious imperialism. This presentation makes a case for thinking about American religious imperialism and the pressing need to decolonize Mormonism."

		"Description": "Jesus said, \"And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.\" This passage raises a number of questions for Latter-day Saints. Does Jesus oppose lawsuits? If so, why does the LDS Church engage in litigation? Would Jesus encourage his church to structure its mission through numerous legal entities, and to operate with limited liability? What impact does LDS legal corporatism have on Mormon culture? This panel discusses research and analysis of all the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saint's Utah incorporating documents."

		"Description": "They fought for their children; like dragons did they fight. In 2013 a group of Mormon mothers with LGBT children organized a support group for themselves. One felt that the term \"Mama Bear\" did not come close to describing the ferocious love and fierce protection they felt for their children, so she named the group Mama Dragons. Since then the group has grown significantly and has been featured in a number of news stories, blogs, radio shows, and live interviews. This panel includes several of the Mama Dragons, sharing their individual stories about what inspires the fire they breathe for their children."
