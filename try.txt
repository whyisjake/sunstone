In new systems for public entrepreneurship, modern pioneers are blazing trails in today's Third World wilderness, suggesting paths others may take to act, to replicate, or otherwise move us toward a genuine Zion on earth. Differentiating between formal Church assignments and informal callings, many LDS advocates today are designing and developing strategies around the globe to empower “the least of these” among God's children. New, ethical visions are becoming linked with practical interventions to make a difference: laboring for justice, building a sense of community, bringing peace to the restless, feeding desperate mothers and their children, all helping to achieve personal redemption by engaging in sacred work among the poorest of the poor. I will examine key elements of social stewardship by LDS individuals, families, ward organizations, neighborhoods, and newly-established humanitarian institutions."

Of course, it's not an arrival but a journey, a constant invitation to abide in the place of no fear. What does a mystic life demand? Likely Coleridge's “willing suspension of disbelief,” which is born in all children. A letting go to listen to the silence, to the spirit. With pioneers in my veins and my mother's “Pray at night, plan in the morning” in my growing up, I would add: Pay attention, maybe to what Plato calls “the divine madness of the poet.” Or more likely, to what is available to anyone as a believer, though having faith, opening the crown, and expecting. For anyone there await informings constant and reasonable, guides to living to the full measure of any day's potential."

Americans and Mormons believe in freedom of speech but also in truth that prevails, in not suffering idiots or naysayers, and in saying something positive and faith-affirming or not saying anything at all. We believe there are things, in fact, that should not even be thought. It is not easy to endure someone who is enfranchised, as we are, to say what is right but who does not. This makes dialogue hard."	SL99112	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL99112.mp3																				"THE SMITHS, THEIR DREAMS AND VISIONS: PART II, JOSEPH SMITH AND THE FAMILY TRIANGLE"	C.

In seeking a context for Joseph Smith's early visions, particularly the First Vision, I will explore the basic family triangle involving Joseph Smith Sr., Lucy Mack Smith, and Joseph Jr. Other members of the Smith family will also be studied, particularly Alvin, in their crucial set of relationships with all concerned. I use the modern concepts of natural family systems to examine the early life experiences and dreams and visions of the various parties, bringing to light new insights and new understandings of Mormonism's founding prophet."

Perhaps even more remarkable, however, is that her exercise of these spiritual gifts was almost totally confined to her immediate family circle, making her an underutilized resource as a model woman for the differing goals of both Mormon feminists and the institutional Church."

Court genealogists for Queen Elizabeth and Ivan the Terrible attempted to link, through genealogy, the entire history of the world from beginning to end, and early Mormon leaders claimed Joseph Smith was of the same seed as the British royal house. My research on medieval European genealogies suggests that Mormons are recapitulating a fascination with lineal descent and genealogical myths that is centuries old. I suggest some reasons why a mythical genealogical history was defended so vehemently in the waning years of the Middle Ages and perhaps why it is equally cherished at the end of the 20th century."

There are few things more common in human life than sexual relations. Sex is, to the species, what food is to the individual: its continuation, the guarantor of its survival. And, as with food, a cult of the exotic surrounds sex: glamour is to sex what haute cuisine is to food. Pornography, though always available as a kind of literary junk food, has nosed its way into haute couture and popular culture as a chic frisson to glamorize the ordinary. As such, it constitutes a full-scale assault on intimacy, a marketing of the most spiritual of appetites, an invasion of wonder by advertising. Does the blatant commercialization of sex leave any room for wonder, for the “wonderful,” or will that word become, in regards to sex, as pejorative as “awful” now is in regards to worship?"

MORMONS' AND OTHER DISCOVERIES: AN UNSCIENTIFIC SURVEY, by Ardean Watts TEN REASONS SUNSTONE IS NOT A CULT. Of late, the symposium has been criticized for its cult-like influence. But Sunstone lacks the characteristics of a cult or charismatic group, often held suspect for exploiting members' resources and dominating their lives. For example: (1) Sunstone holds few meetings; charismatic groups meet often, sometimes even meeting to plan meetings. (2) Symposium participants express diverse beliefs while a cultist group resists questioning, let alone question-answer periods. (3) Sunstone does not monitor and punish sexuality, not even among the young. (4) Symposium participants do not endow Sunstone leaders with powers of inspiration and authority. 'OH BOY, MORMONS!” AND OTHER DISCOVERIES: AN UNSCIENTIFIC SURVEY. More than 200 attendees at the 1994 symposium took Ardean Watts's “Orthodoxy Test”, 36 statements on fundamental LDS beliefs. Respondents were invited to score yes, no, or in-between. The results have been ripening in a forgotten corner of my library for five years. During that time, the test's flaws became apparent and the results more surprising. The question “How do you describe your religious persuasion?” brought more than a hundred different answers including: “good for weddings and funerals” and “Oh, Boy! Mormon.” Attend this session if you are curious about the beliefs of the Sunstone community and for a light-minded look at the notion of orthodoxy."

How do churches deal with inevitable conflict within the organization, with other organizations, with nonmembers, and between members? Is the LDS church unique in its conflict management methods? This study seeks to answer these questions and discover if there is anything to learn from an investigation of conflict resolution strategies of various faiths. Interorganizational, intraorganizational, and interpersonal issues will be examined. RELIGION AND THE “WAR ON DRUGS”: SOME THOUGHTS ON SPIRITUALITY AND MENDACITY. With help from the audience, I propose to explore three interrelated issues: (1) the reasons western, monotheistic religions have tended to vigorously oppose drug use; (2) the role of religious traditions in promoting spirituality; and (3) the apparent contribution by religious communities and their leaders to the very conditions that give rise to the culture of drugs."

As the year 2000 approaches, many Christians are remembering and re-examining Christ's promise of his Second Coming. Joseph Smith and the early Mormons clearly saw the Church's mission as preparing for the Millennium, a thousand years of peace in which Christ will reign personally upon the earth. I address the question, “What is the exact nature of the mission of the restored Church in preparing for Christ's Second Coming?” My answer involves a re-interpretation of the meaning and scope of the Atonement. I argue that the Atonement is not yet complete and explain what still must be accomplished for its fulfillment, including an interpretation of the meaning and nature of Zion. THE ATONEMENT AND THE LAW OF MOSES. Most of the prophets whose words are recorded in our scriptures were working with people who lived under the Law of Moses, and they used it as one of their main tools for helping people to understand Christ. We Latter-day Saints like to think we transcend the law, but not having lived under it, we know only vaguely what we are transcending. Trying to understand Christ without the mediation of the law, we run the risk of not understanding him at all. I try to distinguish two ways of understanding Christ's atonement, one in terms of the Law of Moses and one not."

Caputo	"TOWARD A MESSIANIC POSTMODERNISM: DECONSTRUCTION AND RELIGION Deconstruction is a philosophy that emphasizes the productive role of difference, as opposed to the “modern” or Enlightenment predilection for universality and consensus. There are (at least) two different varieties of this philosophy of difference, depending on which of its two nineteenth-century predecessors, Nietzsche or Kierkegaard, one favors, which I call “Dionysian” and “messianic” postmodernism. Most of the objections that are made against postmodernism have in mind the Dionysian version, but they fall wide of the mark of the messianic version. The line of objections raised against postmodernists, relativism, subjectivism, skepticism, anarchism, antinomianism, anti-institutionalism, nihilism, and despair, takes its lead from the highly Nietzscheanized face of the first version of postmodernism. But as regards the second or messianic version, it is false on its face and very likely betrays the critic's unfamiliarity with the religious and even biblical provenance of a good deal that is going on in deconstruction."

The symposium warranted an official warning from the Church about participation. Still, the symposium continues to provide an independent arena for the careful and energetic examination of our religious tradition."

Christensen"	"JOY LIES IN ANOTHER DIRECTION': HUGH NIBLEY'S CALL TO LEAVE BABYLON AND BUILD ZION Whether anticipating the subject of his last public discourse as he did in his contribution to BYU's Last Lecture Series in 1971 or contemplating breakthroughs he would like to see in BYU's Spheres of Influence speech in 1984, when Hugh Nibley has looked to the future, the theme has always been the contemporary “affluenza” binding the Latter-day Saints to Babylon and the hope that we'll begin living the law of consecration and work to establish Zion. Although it wasn't until rather late in his life that Nibley forcefully addressed these themes in his writings, he has been approaching Zion all his life."

Tull"	"THE IMPATIENCE OF JOB: DISSENT, STIFF-NECKED INTEGRITY, AND SPIRITUAL ENLIGHTENMENT Far from recommending long-suffering endurance and humble submission “to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon” us, the Book of Job argues forcefully for an uncompromising, even defiant, spiritual integrity, an authenticity willing to risk even enmity with God, or at least with the God of conventional religion. Only by owning our full selves, our fears, our resentments, our criticisms of God and his spokesmen, as well as our faith and our hope, can we move with Job past knowing God's name to seeing his face."

Condie, Richard Sherlock"	"A GENERIC SPIRITUAL CREATION A generic spiritual creation provides a solution to the conflict between predestination and free agency, yet it preserves the individual as the distinct entity that coexisted with God in the pre-mortal life. A generic spirit is not intended for any specific organism, but it can be placed in any one of many different life forms of approximately the same degree of complexity. Although God is the creator of generic spirits, geneticists may play an important role in controlling and designing the mortal bodies that house these spirits. The generic spirit model is also compatible with organic evolution as the mechanism by which God populated the earth."

It will try to explain why people--and especially Mormon people--are sometimes hesitant to acknowledge their religion in environments that they perceive as hostile.

Society taxes and contributes to make possible our expensive higher educational system because it accepts that academic freedom, despite the discomfort, even anger, it often creates, serves the long-term best interests of society. Societies that have most supported free inquiry and expression have consistently produced the greatest art and literature and also the best long-term solutions to political and social problems. The freedom accorded what Walter Lippmann called the “indispensable opposition” of minority viewpoints consistently produces more truth--and in the long run, more peace--for society. I trace the fortunes of academic freedom in Utah higher education over the past forty years and argue that it is presently greatest, for both Mormons and non- Mormons, not at the University of Utah or BYU but at Utah Valley State College. I explore ways it could and should be expanded elsewhere."

Do you wake up nights with a sweaty feeling or dread that a mysterious church committee is keeping a file of your private antics to be laughed at from the rooftops on judgment day? Are you now aspiring or have you ever aspired to the calling of Ward Humorist? If you can answer yes to any of these questions, you may be one of the people from whom Ed has pilfered the ideas for this paper.

McKay and Blacks: Building the Foundation for the 1978 Revelation Shortly after David O. McKay became church president in 1951 he traveled to South Africa, the first church president to visit that country. While there, he made an important and impromptu change in the church policy regarding ordination of blacks. While not reversing that policy, he significantly changed the procedure for determining whether South Africans had lineage that disqualified them from priesthood ordination. Several years later, in the face of attempts by the church to establish a foothold in Nigeria, he and his counselors gave serious consideration to the possibility of reversing the exclusionary policy. The subject rose again in the context of the American Civil Rights Movement in the mid-and-late 1960's, and appeared headed for resolution in 1969, although this was due to misinterpretation of President McKay's intent. A flurry of activity by important General Authorities in the final months of President McKay's life served first to raise, then to dash the hopes of those who sought a reversal of the policy."

Liberation Theology is not passive, nor submissive but is most often militant and confrontational.

Chandler	"The Restoration of Some Things In 1840 Joseph Smith declared that animal sacrifices would be restored once the Nauvoo Temple was completed and that this was necessary to bring to pass the 'restoration of all things.” While modern Mormons would most likely be shocked at the thought of including animal sacrifice in their Temple worship, and no temples have been built with sacrificial altars, the requirement to eventually reestablish the ancient rite has never been repudiated. Since the Book of Mormon clearly states that all sacrifices have their end with Jesus' “great and last” sacrifice, it is puzzling that Joseph Smith would have found such a restoration necessary. The answer to the puzzle lies in the millennial hopes and dreams of the early Mormons and in the restorationist theology of the Burned-over District. Clay's paper will explore that history, examine the eschatological theology behind it, and explain how it was supported in most instances by creative misinterpretation of scripture."

Following the same path she took as a developing feminist theorist, Cecilia traces the stages in her response to BYU, from consciousness-raising to personal offense at individual oppressors to activism and vigorous (sometimes detached) critique of the systems of oppression. She concludes that frustration with systemic oppression is a powerful force for activists and theorists, one that can be harnessed to facilitate social change."

Silver, Paul Clark, Gretchen Clark, Homer Lebaron, Norman Bangerter, Hollis Johnson"	"Pianos & Drums: Taking The Gospel Global. What's Universal? What's Cultural? Lessons From Africa In her forthcoming book (fall 2000), Jan Shipps concludes that the last four decades of correlating and streamlining Church programs, materials, and procedures has resulted in the dislodging of Mormonism from its culture of origin and the transforming of it into a religion that can be applied in many different cultures around the world. Every would-be world religion confronts this challenge; darn few succeed. Pioneer stock Mormons who lament the loss of roadshows and bazaars would get little comfort from the Apostle Paul, who told Jewish Christians the Gentile converts did not have to keep the Jewish feast days and traditions. For him, the testimony of Jesus, becoming a new creation, and the unifying Lord's Supper were the universal demands. And yet, ironically, his epistles give specific, opinionated, instructions to the struggling convert congregations. This same dualism between implementing tested ways and allowing cultural diversity exists as the latter-day Zion spreads abroad. Mormonism's twenty-year engagement in Africa shows how our American-born religion must change to be preached and practiced in every tongue. As this panel reflects on their experiences as Church leaders in Africa, we can glimpse and marvel at the work of the Spirit as Mormonism changes Africans and as Africans change Mormonism. Just what is happening? What are the practical, logistical demands in establishing the Church? What long-held assumptions had to be jettisoned? Who joins? Who stays? What traditional Mormon (American?) ways work? Which don't? What can't be changed? How easy is it to separate the gospel from culture? What about spirituality from culture? Is having one world-wide Church program realistic, or will we eventually delegate and decentralize program development? Even in replacing one culture's arbitrary ways with another's, how much diversity even in cultural things can one Church bear? What challenges have we overcome, and what ones loom on horizon? What might a mature Mormon Church in Africa be like?"

Foundation: Non-Relativistic Ethics Within A Finitistic Theology	Kim McCall	"A Different (Yet Still Firm?) Foundation: Non-Relativistic Ethics Within A Finitistic Theology At this symposium twenty years ago, I took up the challenging question of the grounds of moral obligation in a universe that isn't ultimately founded in God's creative acts. In what sense can He command, and what makes anything right or wrong? A commentator complained that my point of view results in an “antinomian, relativistic ethic.” We were recently both quoted in Richard and Joan Ostling's Mormon America. A revisit is long overdue, both because this vital issue appropriately refuses to die, and because this fear of ethical relativism (combined with the great PR value of Mormonism's image as a bastion of morality) may be one of the enticements tempting many toward “the fleshpots of [modern Christian] orthodoxy.” I argue that, although fundamental LDS beliefs should, indeed, radically recast our understanding of moral law, they do not lead to relativism, properly understood. Indeed, they encourage the sort of personal moral experience that best promotes the kind of moral growth and development that are the purpose and design of our mortal existence."

Michael Quinn	"LDS 'Headquarters Culture' And The Rest Of Mormonism: Past And Present The Mormon doctrine of “Gathering” created a distinctive culture at the headquarters of the LDS church. During founder Joseph Smith's life, this “headquarters culture” had pronounced differences of theology, Church practice, and culture from the experience of Mormons who lived distant from the headquarters. This had profound consequences following Joseph's 1844 martyrdom. This paper examines the significance and changes of LDS headquarters culture in Smith's lifetime, in pioneer Utah Mormonism, and in 20th-century Mormonism. I also suggest possible directions for the headquarters culture in the 21st century. In addition to emphasizing the distant past, this presentation invites the audience to participate in walking down “Memory Lane” by sharing their own experiences with this dynamic."

But if evil were an essential part of reality, if it were necessary, would it not in some sense be good, because good would depend on it? If good and evil were inextricably connected, how could we distinguish between them? I will explore these questions and show that the belief that evil is a necessary part of reality has far-reaching and pernicious consequences. An alternate view of the nature of reality, which sees the feminine- masculine duality as the fundamental opposition in universal reality, will be presented. I will also distinguish sin from evil and argue that while sin is an inevitable part of existence, evil is not. 2nd Abstract- (Dr Huff) I use the work of contemporary philosopher Alvin Plantinga to draw support for the LDS belief that persons exist uncreate. Plantinga presents perhaps the most convincing explanation by a traditional Christian of how there can be evil in the creation of a perfectly good and perfectly powerful creator. However, Plantinga concedes there must be a contingent state of affairs that holds independent of God's will. I argue this concession entails a greater compromise to the classical notion of God's sovereignty than Plantinga admits."

These very same techniques, accepted as authoritative in the court room, are applied by science to address the question of humans' nearest relatives in the animal kingdom. The DNA testifies of the continuity with nature and a close relationship between humans and African apes, with a common ancestor as recent as 5-7 mya. Corroborating evidence mounts as an ever- expanding fossil record documents an African origin of hominids and the evolutionary transition to the modern human physical tabernacle.Paper 2 - The Tree Of Life 2- Abstract How can the scientific data, which suggest that we descended from animals that lived and died on this planet for millions of years, be reconciled with the religious perspective that Adam and Eve, the first humans, were immortal?

As investigations eventually exposed Hofmann as a forger and murderer, the story does not end with his conviction and imprisonment. Besides the tragic and lasting consequences for the families involved, the effects of Hofmann's career as a forger and con man remain, as document dealers and collectors continue to purchase previously unknown Hofmann forgeries, struggle to overcome the financial loss from items purchased before 1985, and otherwise deal with unanswered questions that remain."

Utahans have flocked to see God's Army more than any other movie this year. Since opening in Salt Lake City in March, it has played, is now playing, and continues to open in major cities throughout the United States, and will soon be released internationally. What are people saying about a movie based on the exploits of an apartment of Mormon missionaries serving in Los Angeles? Does its success mean that there's a viable big-screen market for LDS films and LDS audiences? Is God's Army the breakthrough Saturday's Warrior for Mormon film, and can we now expect a flood of copycats? What lessons should be learned about telling Mormon stories to Mormons. And is Mormonism at the point where orthodox artists can tell their stories in ways that resonate within and beyond the LDS community?

Society taxes and contributes to make possible our expensive higher educational system because it accepts that academic freedom, despite the discomfort, even anger, it often creates, serves the long-term best interests of society. Societies that have most supported free inquiry and expression have consistently produced the greatest art and literature and also the best long-term solutions to political and social problems. The freedom accorded what Walter Lippmann called the “indispensable opposition” of minority viewpoints consistently produces more truth--and in the long run, more peace--for society. I trace the fortunes of academic freedom in Utah higher education over the past forty years and argue that it is presently greatest, for both Mormons and non- Mormons, not at the University of Utah or BYU but at Utah Valley State College. I explore ways it could and should be expanded elsewhere."

Logic says no, but scriptures, the physics of light, and near-death experiences support a paradoxical reality. Everything in the universe is interconnected yet separate.

To them, this divinity invites into the law Judeo- Christian principles. Is it this claimed feature that legitimizes Church involvement in politics? In the May 27 Church section of the Deseret News, the First Presidency stated that it “rarely takes a position on pending legislation and does so only when it involves an important moral issue.” Is there an implied Constitutional moral substance known to LDS leaders? Do these moral substances supersede the religious neutrality stated in the Constitution's First Amendment? Does law depend upon this moral substance to legitimize it?

Historically, this was not always the case. With the passing of time, attitudes have become increasingly conservative, with an emphasis on a literal interpretation of the LDS canon.

What would it have taken for Joseph Smith or one of his contemporaries to have written the Book of Mormon? What would it take for someone to write a book like the Book of Mormon today? As a literary and textual critic with a specialty in the American Renaissance, I postulate that six things would be necessary to produce a text that claimed to be of ancient origin--time, talent, knowledge, imagination, sophistication and an incredible amount of luck.

The Decalogue occurs in two versions--one in Exodus, another in Deuteronomy--which (especially the events at Sinai) are irreconcilable.

Having never presided at the Church's local levels, he gained pastoral experience while in the First Presidency. Although he emphasized high-level administration and public speaking, Counselor Clark occasionally engaged in personal proselytizing, in performing healing ordinances, and in comforting those who mourn. In addition, he spoke with Mormons about abortion, birth control, mixed marriages (of race or religion), personal business ventures, self-righteousness, their giving unsolicited advice to the First Presidency, women's rights, and the Word of Wisdom.

Matthew Hilton, a local lawyer and conservative activist, assisted the Citizens' group in compiling ten counts of misconduct against Weaver and petitioning the Utah Fourth District Court for summary judgment. Although the Citizens' document is in many ways reflective of national anti-gay prosecution, it also bears highly distinctive marks of Mormon cultural perceptions and anxieties. Hilton's imagery portrays a spectral lesbian sect in a striking inversion of the Mormon institution, complete with secret initiatory rites, a two-by-two missionary force, a female hierarchy of authority, and indications of polygamy. The Citizens' document is, among other things, an artifact of contemporary Mormon culture, an example of one culture's fears of its own projected likeness."

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints then launched an effort to transport Mormon culture whole to distant members. This culture bloomed in the 1940s and 50s, gradually receding as church resources were concentrated outside the established stakes and the family was newly emphasized. This paper will be a fond memoir of the days when members trooped to the ward house almost daily for activities and fellowship, before the church retreated from the effort to fill all the needs of the members. The Church was then the place to learn elocution, part-singing, and the tango, a place of extravagant events.

McKay and the 'Twin Sisters': Free Agency and Tolerance David O. McKay served as church president for nearly two decades and left a positive legacy that continues to enlighten church leaders and members to this day. He was a highly principled man, both in dealing with individuals and in administering the affairs of the church, and the bedrock of his principles was a firm commitment to free agency. The firmness of that commitment was shaped to a large extent by his personal exposure to and aversion to Communism, which he considered to be the antithesis of free agency. However, he realized that other forms of government as well as non-governmental groups and individuals were always at risk of abusing their powers and thus limiting the exercise of free agency among their constituency. A firm commitment to free agency demands an equivalent commitment to tolerance of divergent views and demands action. Using eight case studies, this paper will examine the remarkable extent to which President McKay respected both free agency and tolerance, thus endearing himself to Latter- day Saints across the philosophical spectrum, as well as to a large non-LDS community."

I argue that spiritual gifts were initially available to lay members of the Mormon church in the 1830s under clerical supervision, and limits evolved during the Kirtland period regarding “appropriate” spiritual manifestations. Women exercised some of the same spiritual gifts as male priesthood holders in conjunction with their work in the Nauvoo Female Relief Society in the 1840s and beyond. I further argue that two factors contributed to the demise of women's spiritual gifts: the gradual clericalization of spiritual gifts and their absorption into priesthood function and the disbanding of the Relief Society in 1844 which had functioned as a nascent parallel to the male priesthood."

The question, “Are Mormons Christian?” has been heard ever since 1830, and it has been pressed forward in recent years by both anti- Mormon Christians and by Mormons who are trying to convince other Christians. I would like to turn the tables on the question, and use Mormon Christianity as a frame through which to discuss what Christianity is really all about. I will explore four interrelated issues: 1) the “grace versus works” question; 2) the question, What would it mean to live as a Christian two thousand years after Jesus (which also gets into what I call “ontological Christianity,” or Christianity seen primarily as a metaphysical system); 3) the idea of the restoration of early Christianity; 4) Mormonism as a commutarian movement."

While the practice of a committee imposing a creedal statement of belief on a congregation is anathema to Mormons, the use of the literary form of the creed by individuals is a helpful spiritual discipline. It forces one to confront the questions, “Just what do I believe?” and “What are the issues, ideas, and concepts that animate my religious life?” The sharing of these core religious doctrines and ideas from one person's life inspires others."

Following the respected methods of 20th century biblical scholarship, Thomas applies the tools of textual, historical, and literary criticisms to the Book of Mormon. Because Mormons have been too afraid to see how radical their book of scripture is, and non-Mormons too angry about its claims, According to Thomas, the book remains undiscovered; it is, in fact, still buried in Cumorah."

Rees, Reverend Carolyn Tanner Irish, Reverend Rodger Russell, Owen Cummings"	"Should Churches Seek Forgiveness Within the past several years, various organizations, governments, and ecclesiastical institutions have sought forgiveness for past, and in some instances, current wrongs. Recently, on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope John Paul apologized for sins Catholics committed against Jews, African Americans, women, and those sexually abused by the clergy. And Southern Baptists have issued a formal apology for their racist practices. At the same time, other governments, institutions, and churches have refused to apologize for historic wrongs. Japan has yet to formally apologize for its reign of terror in China, the Australian government refuses to apologize for a century of oppression of its aboriginal peoples, and some churches feel that it is inappropriate to officially seek forgiveness. What responsibility do churches have for past wrongs committed by its leaders and members? Is seeking forgiveness as one recent commentator has said just “quasi-political chic” or an indispensable act in healing and reconciliation? Do churches demonstrate weakness or strength when they apologize for historic injustices? Representatives of different faiths explore these dimensions."

Michael Quinn	"Prelude to 'Defense of Marriage' Campaign: Civil Discrimination Against Feared or Despised Minorities America's “Defense of Marriage” campaign against legal unions for homosexuals is the most recent example of using lofty slogans to defend the denial of civil rights to feared or despised minorities. Catholics, Mormons, Protestants, Jews, African-Americans, Asian- Americans, Native American Indians, and Polynesians have supported “Defense of Marriage” acts (DOMA) in various states even though this is an echo of racist and religious bigotry in their own histories. Even so-called “liberals” in these groups have supported DOMA laws. The persecuted sometimes become the persecutors.

This means that God is the supreme governor and ruler of the universe. Everything is planned out, and nothing contravenes his will. Furthermore, everything is planned out for the best.

No bodies were found. Biological materials associated with both were recovered from a taxidermist's bandsaw Kleasen had access to. In 1975 Kleasen was sentenced to death for their murders but three years later won a reversal based on an illegal search. Kleasen remained in prison or on parole on other crimes until 1990 when he disappeared. Last fall at age 67, he turned up in Britain as a criminal defendant in new weapons charges with assured deportation back to the United States. The Travis County District Attorney in Austin has also reopened the case, and it is considering reprosecuting him for the murders.

My move to Sandy resulted in my being submerged into the sea of Mormania. To that time, my contact with “the Church” had been limited to a few open-door meetings with two neatly dressed young men with name badges on their dark suits. Over the years, I have come to learn a lot about the LDS Church, and many times the increased familiarity brought on more than a few chuckles. Between 1958 and 1995, I covered Eastern Europe as a journalist for the Dutch radio and television; from 1984 as a correspondent in Belgrade, the capital of former federal Yugoslavia. My career gave me an intimate knowledge of the communist machine, and upon moving to Utah, I was amazed by the striking similarities between the LDS and communist party rites and habits, in spite of their highly opposite philosophies. My paper will share a few of those similarities, centering on the use by both organizations of group control techniques and symbols."

This personality would have been partly the result of his cultural (American Frontier) background, his family environment, and even his childhood typhoid illness and traumatic surgery. There have been few attempts to understand him psychologically, and virtually none from devout Mormonism, despite the challenge by Jan Shipps more than 20 years ago to solve “the prophet puzzle.” This paper will review four interesting ones, three from outside Mormonism, and one (partly) from within, by Whitsitt (1885), Riley (1902), Brink (1976) and Morain (1998)."

This paper will look at ways in which the actions of the Conference reflect the shift from sect to denomination, with the name change being a symbol of that shift. The conference's focus on issues like gun control and capital punishment, and the School of the Americas (taking liberal political positions on all three issues) is part of that shift. Also, the conference did not take legislative action on two big issues facing us: (1) accepting the baptisms of other denominations and (2) ordination of gays and lesbians; however there were positive signs at the conference on these two issues despite the legislative inaction on them. But there were also signs of continued authoritarianism."

In fact God is presented as the great example of personality toward which all other persons must strive. If persons other than God are viewed as literal children of God or “gods in embryo” they are also God in microcosm. A Mormon idea of Grace should include not only God's Grace towards us but Grace between all persons. Grace is founded in freedom and is extended toward others.

Peterson, the man behind the scraggly mustache, who is often clad in--yes--Levi's, fastened with one of those gaudy Western buckles, looks as if he may have stepped out of one of his own fictions, preferably, The Backslider.

Over two decades, the novel has moved generations of Mormons and far- flung cultural fellow travelers to mordant laughter and scalding tears.

However, this is not very often conceded by Latter-day Saints themselves. Saying that God is finite seems to be a very good starting point to solving the problem of evil, on the one hand. But, on the other hand, saying that God's power is limited seems to imply that God's plan might fail. Mormons seem to want to make assertions that imply that God is limited and yet they also want to claim that his power is absolutely sovereign. Just how much power does God have?

The world watched the legal conflict that questioned the very essence of what constitutes wedlock and raised controversy relating to prosecutions, persecutions and the private place of plural marriage. The trial addressed charges of bigamy and criminal nonsupport, with the possibility of a future hearing to air a charge of child rape. The legal battle pitted Juab County attorney David Leavitt, the Utah governor's younger brother, against the gregarious Green and his five wives. Besides revealing the inner workings of a fascinating apostate LDS lifestyle, Green's trial again raises the issues of the legality and possible religious rights relating to polygamy and poses a fascinating duel between church and state."

Michael Quinn	"Exporting Utah's Theocracy Since 1975: Mormon Organizational Behavior and America's Culture Wars Contrary to most theocracies, Mormon Utah has always required democratic participation for its theocracy. Two major transitions bracketed the twentieth-century manifestation of Utah Mormon theocracy. Beginning in the 1890s, Utah's democratic theocracy had to confront significant political dissent from faithful Mormons and to accommodate non-Mormon political power. By the 1990s, the non-Mormon accommodation persisted, but internal dissent had become politically insignificant. Of greater interest was the process by which LDS headquarters after 1975 exported its democratic theocracy to the nation at large. This required politicizing the Mormon rank-and-file's adoration of the living prophet, claiming that decisions of the hierarchy are without error, appealing to basic fears within the national population, forging political alliances with formerly hostile religious groups, and organizing a permanent LDS network for political activism on national, state, regional, and local levels. The result is that LDS headquarters in Utah can determine the outcome of political votes in states which have less than one percent Mormon population. By any standard, this is an extraordinary development in American politics and society.

Many of us have direct, first-hand knowledge of the 'dark side” of hierarchical organizations - they tend to be rigid, controlling, and inflexible. Yet, a full understanding requires us to acknowledge that there are some things they do well. Indeed, some ask whether they should be changed at all. There are inevitable trade-offs faced by leaders when they strive to balance what are, in many ways, antithetical approaches for structuring their organizations.

What does the Greek word, mystery, actually mean? What did it mean to Paul who wrote and spoke in Greek? What did it mean to Joseph Smith and the other early presidents of the Church? What does it mean to modern presidents? Seventeenth-century biblical scholar, Jean Daill'e, coined the term arcana doctrina in reference to secret traditions, which Christ taught only to his Apostles because they were too sacred for the general membership of the primitive Christian church. Daill'e presented evidence that the Apostles later taught these secret traditions to a number of trusted presbyters who taught them in turn, during the post-Apostolic period, to such a select few that these traditions were eventually lost to Christianity. Does the LDS faith possess an arcana doctrina? If so, then where are they taught and who is teaching them? If not, then why does the LDS faith lack what was present in the primitive church as organized by Jesus Christ? I hope to answer these and other questions in my presentation."

The price of traditional faith, she says, is your integrity. The story was, I feared at the time of its publication, an allegory representing my own career. However, the reception by the liberal Mormon community of that story and of my other writings and presentations of the early 1980's proved it to be otherwise. After decades of feeling spiritually alienated from my Christian heritage, I found myself feeling at one with it.

Golden Kimball's life in such a way that he had to deal with its financial impact for the rest of his life. The second section examines more general issues: the confrontation between the federal government and the Church that led to the 'Great Accommodation” by the latter, how a lack of access to the national money supply led to the creation of an elaborate medium of exchange within the Church in the form of promissory notes or tithing scrip, and the Church's uncertain survival in the depths of this financial crisis.

Is God the most powerful force in the world, or is it process, creativity, the moral law, love, or something else?

Toward a New Understanding of What It Means To Be “Mormon” How Big Is the Mormon Tent? Toward a New Understanding of What It Means To Be “Mormon” What is in a name? . . .Apparently a lot! As recent interviews and official announcements have indicated, as the Church sets sail on its twenty-first century mission, it is signaling that it hopes to lead in determining who is and is not “Mormon” as well as which doctrines and practices from its past it will take into the future. This is a moment at the crossroads. As the Church grows into a truly global religion, the Mormon tent will need to broaden to accommodate members and spiritual styles from different cultures. At the same time, it is moving in a direction that seems to be more restrictive, that strives to project an image of uniformity, that takes pains to define and exclude heresy. This panel discussion will wrestle with these issues, especially focusing on possible ways to re-envision what it means to be “Mormon” that honor the Church's rich and varied past and present, as well as what would be appropriate for the future. Our panelists represent four ways people normally define themselves as Mormon: mainstream Mormon, liberal or cultural Mormon, fundamentalist Mormon, and excommunicated but believing Mormon. Each will first briefly explain their position and claims to be a legitimate member of the Mormon community. Then, through comments and interactions with Jan Shipps and Armand Mauss, participants will explore the possibilities of finding a fifth way: Can a new definition of what it means to be Mormon emerge?

It touches on many things, including faith, integrity ambition, sexuality, and community. Earnest at times, and slightly irreverent at others, it explores, reflects, and celebrates some of the interesting (and peculiar) aspects of Mormon culture. Synopsis: Full of anticipation, Elder Robert Wood packs for his mission. As the great, great grandson of Epaphroditus Wood, the greatest missionary in Church history, Elder Wood believes he, too, will be a powerful instrument in the Lord's hands to call sinners to repentance, work miracles, and convert many to the Truth. However, things do not go as expected, and as he nears the end of his mission, Elder Wood has not baptized a soul. His mission president gives him one last chance to redeem himself before going home. He charges Wood with turning Elder Diaz, an incoming missionary with a troubled past, into a strong member of the Church. Wood tries to inspire his new disciple; however, Diaz's free spirit gets both him and Wood into comical situations, and his probing mind soon has Wood questioning everything he had held sacred. Elder Wood's wrestling finally creates a missionary to make his great, great grandfather, Epaphroditus, proud."

In particular, I have begun to note differences in attitudes towards sexuality in women who were raised LDS, yet taken to church by relatives and friends, in contrast to attitudes of those who had a more traditional Mormon upbringing.

What do the scriptures, Joseph Smith, and other early Church leaders teach about the grand design and purposes of God's non-human creations? Does having “dominion” over the kingdom of creatures mean we are their predators and exploiters or does it suggest a “stewardship” relationship in which we become their caretakers in order to help them “fulfill the full measure of their creation?” If the scriptures teach, “woe be unto man that sheddeth blood or wasteth flesh and have no need,” and “the blood of every beast will I require at your hands,” what rationale could be used to explain Church-owned, revenue-generating enterprises such as Deseret Land and Livestock and the Westlake Hunting Preserve?

Though expecting a massive influx of people, Church agents there were under-funded and overworked, with preparations beginning too late. The tremendous task of outfitting and providing handcarts for some two thousand Saints expecting to journey to Zion that season virtually overwhelmed them.

Sillito"	"Reconciling the Utah Tax Code with LDS Scripture: 'Equality' vs. the Income Gap Latter-day revelation states that 'it is not given that one man should possess that which is above another” (D&C 49:20). And the Book of Mormon instructs us to freely impart of our substance to the poor (Mosiah 4:16-21), even to the extent that they are economically equal with us (Jacob 2:17). Despite all this, Utah's majority LDS legislature maintains a tax code that is highly regressive, favoring big business and the rich over the poor. This paper takes a look at the political legacy that may have caused this economic policy, and at the viewpoints of LDS members and state legislators on the subject. It then makes a case for a critical look at Utah's political establishment regarding economic policy and the phenomenon among LDS voters to support that establishment."

Religions profoundly affect the ways in which people view their sexuality and how they express it in their lives. Mormon theology has several fundamental teachings which promote a positive view of sexuality and sexual relations, but the Church also has practices and teachings which often have a negative influence on people's sexual lives. Although Mormon theology teaches that sex is eternal and fundamentally good, Mormons experience all the sexual problems that humanity is heir to.

This session offers a historical and legal perspective on pertinent constitutional arguments, and tries to predict their future success with the Supreme Court. The (ironic) conclusion: Fundamentalist Mormons can expect constitutional protection when the court extends the line of Griswold v. Connecticut (legalizing birth control) and Roe v.

Death is often portrayed as a 'gateway” to the next life, a necessary step in the plan of eternal progression. However, this approach overlooks many profound life lessons we might learn and experience through giving serious contemplation and consideration to death, including our own mortality. In this paper, I contrast the ritualization of death in LDS culture with experiential reflection on death as developed by two thinkers, the Danish existentialist theologian Soren Kierkegaard and the contemporary philosopher Herbert Fingarette. I argue that we can come to understand a lesson of universal importance voiced by Kierkegaard, that learning to die well is the highest wisdom of life."

Even though the First Amendment to the Constitution legally uncoupled the church and the civil government in the United States, a strong scholarly case has been made that a powerful de facto Protestant establishment remained in place for well over a century. This paper will show that the establishment pattern lingered on for generations, but will contend that it was particularly persistent in the nation's cities where establishments were not always Protestant. Showing that practically all of these virtual establishments withered away during the 20th century, the paper will argue that while its consequences are more visible in the culture than in economics and politics, a de facto establishment is alive and well in Salt Lake City."

Rees, Kathleen Flake"	"Why Mormons Should Celebrate Holy Week The week between Jesus' triumphant entry into Jerusalem and his triumphant resurrection from the dead is the most significant week in human history. Beginning with the early church, Christians celebrated the events of this week and for two millennia they have been the focus of annual celebrations of what has been called the Passion of our Lord, Jesus Christ. Beginning with Palm Sunday and moving through Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Holy Saturday, Christians throughout the world mark the last great events in Christ's life. All of these holy days lead us to the great drama of Easter Sunday when the angel rolled back the stone from the tomb and said to his disciples, 'He is not here, for he is risen.” Latter-day Saints celebrate the last of these holy days, but not the others, and yet there is no doctrinal reason why we cannot join with other Christians in offering our devotions throughout this week. His presentation offers an historical overview of Holy Week and presents the case that Latter-day Saints, especially with the Church's new emphasis on being the Church of Jesus Christ, should join with other Christians in making this an annual holy festival."

The atoning sacrifice of Christ makes it possible for us to be reconciled with God; without the Atonement all humanity would be lost and in bondage to sin, death, and the devil. The Atonement is necessary for salvation. Why is it necessary and why does it bring about salvation? Some theories of the Atonement raise difficulties that seem more problematic than the questions they are meant to answer. If God is merciful, why does he require a sacrifice for sin? Why can't he just forgive us? If Christ is punished for our sins, how does this satisfy justice? If Jesus' death is necessary, is it a good or a bad thing? Are the perpetrators of it sinners or do they fulfill God's will? Does the Atonement exalt suffering and in some way justify abuse? In this paper I will explore these questions, seeking an understanding of the Atonement that is grounded in God's love and shows how this love works to bring about freedom from sin, death, and oppressive powers."		http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/.mp3																				The Spirituality of Generation X	"Nick Gorrell, Jodi Hildebrandt, Holly Welker, Ardell Broadbent"	"The Spirituality of Generation X It is always difficult to define what makes a 'generation.” The very term itself asks for a chronological answer; yet, when we discuss a generation, we are most often asking cultural questions. What characteristics do a group of people born within an approximate twenty-four year span share with each other? What events or societal trends have helped shape their experience? Do they have in common certain assumptions about life? The term “Generation X” has been applied to the post-boomer generation that most social scientists agree to as referring to those born from the early 1960s to early 1980s. Sometimes referred to derogatorily as a “generation adrift” or even a “slacker” generation because of what appears to some as an apathetic attitude (in comparison to the idealism of the young adults of the 1960s), it is nevertheless a generation with a deep spirituality that is simply different from that of their parents. There is much talk about the “graying” of the Sunstone crowd. It is therefore very important to listen to members of this younger generation tell of their own spiritual journeys."

I examine various examples of irony in the Book of Mormon, especially verbal and dramatic irony, and look at them in relation to Joseph Smith's writing and the long tradition of irony from the ancient Greeks and Hebrews up to the nineteenth century."

But it couldn't erase the Church's 300,000 debt and its toll on President Woodruff. He had collapsed during the dedication of the 4,000,000 Salt Lake Temple. Many members had quit paying tithing. So paying off old loans while needing money to promote home industry such as the sugar beet and electric power projects wasn't possible. Would Church efforts in the east to get more loans succeed? What about other money-making opportunities such as mining and milling?"

Kimball"	"Committed Same-sex Unions: Is a Theological Accommodation Possible? This paper explores a theological argument for legitimizing committed same-sex unions. It asks if there are scriptural and theological warrants for such a step by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and other churches, especially if the bible is read holistically. I offer thoughts on various interpretive approaches to scripture and tradition, specifically applying them to the most common passages cited in opposition to homosexual unions. Finally, I ask if the theological tenets taught by Jesus Christ might support a revised understanding of these passages and lead to a change in policy concerning committed same-sex unions."

There are today thousands of Mormon websites and hundreds of online LDS communities around the world, and the Mormon presence on the Internet affects millions of people. This panel will explore some of the following questions: Who is it that makes up the Mormon virtual community? Is it one community or many? What are some pros and cons of virtual Mormonism? Are virtual and non-virtual LDS communities segregated cultures? To what extent should the LDS church control Mormon discourse on the World Wide Web?

Her book, Sojourner in the Promised Land: Forty Years among the Mormons, is a compilation of her writings for the past thirty years, much of it a personal, intellectual biography that details her encounters with and observations of the Latter-day Saints. In it, Shipps discusses her methods for researching and writing about the Mormons, the evolution of media images of the Saints, how she became in some ways a virtual extension of the Church's public communications division, Brigham Young's continuing influence in today's Mormonism, the challenges of Church growth, whether Mormons are 'Christian,” and much more.

Rees, Mary Ellen Roberston, Cindy le Fevre"	"Does an 'Open Forum' Mean an 'Open Microphone'?: The Controversy at Sunstone West This April, a controversy erupted surrounding the program for the 2001 Sunstone West Symposium. The event involved the paper proposal, 'The Hidden Nazi Mentality in the Proclamation on the Family,” by Cindy LeFevre, which was first accepted but then removed from the program. The entire affair has been very upsetting to all parties, but it nevertheless raises important issues that should be addressed as Sunstone moves into the future. In this session, panel members will trace the history of the controversy, but, more importantly, they will try to clarify questions about what it means to say that Sunstone is striving to be an “open forum.” Does this mean that Sunstone should have an “open mike” where anyone can say anything? If so, what are the possible consequences to the organization as the sponsor of such a gathering? If not, what standards in terms of scholarship, topic, and tone are, or should be applied, when considering proposals for symposiums? How should these decisions be made and by whom? When does the exercise of “discretion” turn into an act of “censorship”?"

To some he was brotherly, gracious, pastoral and collegial; to others he could be sarcastic, bitter, paternalistic, or dismissive. No doubt to the surprise of some twenty-first century minds, he could also be funny, clever, tender, and supportive. He was a master at adapting the tone of his written communications to the recipient and the message.

From a strictly naturalistic view, the last fifty years have failed to bring much support for the supernatural claims of Joseph Smith. On the other hand, critics have been compiling evidence that contradicts those claims. Yet, Mormonism continues to thrive and expand, suggesting psychological reasons for the beliefs that the general membership and investigators do not want to disrupt. This paper will discuss the psychological reasons for continued belief. I will include comparisons to the growth of religious fundamentalism in the Muslim, Jewish, and Christian worlds, as well as the general psychological benefits of religious belief throughout time."

Or, Can a Mormon Be a Buddhist?: How Might Latter-day Saints Think of the Other Religions Recent discussions of the plurality of religions have centered around three possible stances toward another's religion. We can be exclusivists claiming that our tradition is the only true one and that all others are wrong. Any investigation of the other is only to show how it is wrong or it is whoreing after false gods. We can be an inclusivist claiming that all religions are really versions of our own, which is the true faith. Or we can be pluralists and claim that all religions are somehow true, that they are examples of a transcendent truth that is beyond the finite expression of any one faith, or perhaps that different religions may represent different truths. In this paper, I use the metaphor of marriage to indicate problems with each of these positions. I find Mormons that fit into all three."

One is politics (secular); the other religious (the Church). Both rely on punishment to control, and both claim to supersede wisdom, truth, and justice. Both claim ultimate authority. What is the latest thinking about these two punitive institutions? A delegate at the 1787 Philadelphia Convention argued that a community needed one and only one supreme authority with the capacity to punish.

Michael Quinn"	"Mormon Criminal Element in Nauvoo: The Multi-Faceted Tragedy of the Hodge Brothers There is a strong tendency to idealize “the Nauvoo period” of Mormon history. What is often overlooked is that Nauvoo was still a frontier town, prone to many of the same struggles facing all settlements of this period. One of these struggles was crime, and not all Nauvoo criminals were Gentiles. Using the brutal murders of a Mennonite minister and his son-in-law by two Mormon brothers, William and Stephen Hodge, as a springboard, this paper explores the issue of the Mormon criminal element in Nauvoo. In exploring the tragedy of these murders and the subsequent trial, hangings, and newspaper coverage of the Hodge saga, we gain a deeper understanding of frontier Nauvoo in the year immediately following the death of Joseph Smith. The story of crime in Nauvoo reaches into the struggle between Brigham Young and William Smith for control of the Church; it highlights the mindset in which every murder was seen as evidence of the plottings of “secret combinations”; and it raises questions about the role of Hosea Stout and the Nauvoo police in possible incidents of “blood atonement.”"	SL01364	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL01364.mp3																				The Globe Editorial and Mormon Feminist Activism	"Maxine Hanks, Jody England Hansen"	"The Globe Editorial and Mormon Feminist Activism In October 2000, Mormon feminists made history by publishing a group statement in the Boston Globe.

The editorial was re-published one week later in the Salt Lake Tribune with the signers' names. This historic statement resembled a declaration of independence.

William Nicholson"	"Christ and Culture in Conflict: The Gospel and the Homosexual Those who believe the gospel of Jesus Christ regards homosexuality as an evil to be condemned usually point to various scriptures in the Bible and portray the controversy today as a conflict between the gospel and a modern culture that has grown more tolerant of something the Bible condemns. Thus, in their eyes, the conflict is 'Christ versus culture.” This paper argues that this question does indeed involve a conflict between “Christ and culture,” but asks if the defenders of tradition might have it backwards. Looking at the totality of Jesus Christ's teachings, might not one argue that homosexuals are accepted in God's sight on an equal basis with heterosexuals? Might not those passages in the Bible which treat homosexuality as evil be treated as the influence of ancient Israelite culture, in the same way many read cultural influences in the biblical writings which condone slavery and polygamy and assume a patriarchal social order which today we would all deplore as immoral?"

Just a few months earlier, in his book, Fatherless America, David Blankenhorn examined society's traditional prescription to men to be husbands and fathers. Husband/father as a universal role for men is woven into the fabric of the Proclamation on the Family. Drawing on Blankenhorn's research, I will explore this role. As set forth in the Proclamation on the Family, the husband/father role informs tradition, practice, and policy, including male-only priesthood ordination, the “forever family,” the Church's recent defense of the Boy Scouts of America in the lawsuit concerning gay scout leaders, and opposition to same-sex unions."

This paper will also examine longer, more complex chiasms. Applying the criteria of a growing number of Bible scholars to the complex Book of Mormon chiasms proposed by John W. Welch and Donald W. Parry, I will demonstrate that the vase majority depart from what the chiasmists themselves call 'symmetrical parallelism.” Most exhibit imbalance, asymmetry, questionable demarcation, mixed parallel styles, and arbitrary omission and inclusion of key elements. Additionally, many proposed examples ignore and disrupt more dominant literary patterns and serve no discernable literary purpose. Even if we allow for the possibility that complex chiasmus might occasionally appear in the Book of Mormon, the multitude of near-misses points to what statisticians call the fallacy of the enumeration of favorable circumstances, or emphasizing the successes while disregarding the failures."

This time of testing therefore involves real threats to identity that are linked to separation from home, encounters with alien cultures and alternative faiths, and challenges to personal and interpersonal beliefs about oneself.

Pragmatism honors individual temperaments while calling us to adventure and a robust engagement with life. Yet, it also contains strong correctives that are especially useful as we find ourselves occasionally spiraling off into universes of our own making or riding too enthusiastically on our own elegant but narrowly focused hobby-horses. If it were understood better and its criteria for judging truths were more explicitly applied, it could be demonstrated that we-individually and within our tradition-would greatly benefit from this international application of pragmatis."

There are several indications that the Vision was an out-of-body experience. Once the Vision is framed as such, we can then apply what we know about out-of-body experiences to our interpretation of the Vision and greatly expand our understanding of it.

Opposition to gay rights initiatives is often based on religious belief that homosexuality is sinful. This is true for the Mormon Church that has been in the forefront of efforts to fight gay marriage and civil rights. Since this is a faith-based social policy, it could be enlightening to understand the scriptural basis of this strongly held Mormon stand against homosexuality.

The Role of Visual Image in Belief If immediate impressions of God the Father's countenance, hair color, age, race, voice, wardrobe, or dwelling place come to mind, chances are good that Michelangelo, Charlton Heston, or an Ensign illustration helped put those images into your head. History has proven that there is great power in religious images to clarify, teach, enlighten, comfort, confuse, mislead, and deeply offend. Such poser was especially present for early Christianity’s illiterate membership, but religious images clearly continue to impact even the very educated today. By focusing on popular portrayals, of the Father - from Renaissance masterpieces to 20th century cinema to LDS depictions of the The First Vision - this session will examine the evolution of traditional Christian and Mormon thought about who God is and how we fit into the picture."

While praying in the MTC, I received a definite answer that I should not go on this mission, but I disregarded the message and continued into the field. While in Texas, I struggled with the work and my decision until my final twenty-four hours. And only then did I finally come to feel I had made a good choice. I will focus on the events leading up to this final day, especially the feeling of peace I received and my discovery that God's respect for our freedom is so great he will work even with our disobedience."

As a young boy, he overheard long discussions about World War I around the family dinner table. He later served as a non-commissioned intelligence officer in World War II. These experiences and his knowledge of ancient history convinced him that war in general is a “nasty and immoral business”, a conviction that has never left him and which has made him a consistent and effective voice for pacifism in Utah and the Church."

Kay Gillespie"	"SL02112,  As a faith community becomes successful in ways the world measures success, it becomes easy for its members to live in a relatively low state of tension with the surrounding culture. As part of the “get tough on crime” attitude common in the culture today, the majority of Americans favor the death penalty for the most serious crimes. I argue that capital punishment is both immoral and impractical, and it should be opposed on both religious and secular grounds by Christians, including those of us who also call ourselves Saints."

Hatch"	"SL02113, The variations among First Vision accounts have always attracted our attention. Initially, this was due to the polemical tendencies of early studies of Mormon origins, which tried to disprove the veracity of Smith's experience. Later inquiries were driven by historians who sought to discover the causal reasons for Mormonism's appearance on the American religious scene. This paper will approach the First Vision accounts as conversion stories, with variations seen as indicators of shifts within Smith's own worldview."	SL02113	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL02113.mp3																				Unraveling the History and Mystery of the Priesthood	"Margie Gee, Dan Vogel"	"SL02114, Research and a close analysis of scriptures and the historical record strongly suggest that Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery did not receive the priesthood in the manner supposed by most Latter-day Saints. This study also shows it to be unlikely that the priesthood was part of ancient Israel's religious practices until the time of the Exodus, nor, apparently, were priests part of early Christian leadership for some two-hundred years. These findings open the door to a wider interpretation about who has authority to speak and act in the name of God."

But what of poetry inspired by the Book of Mormon? Is the Mormon poetic tradition deep enough for a Book of Mormon anthology? Drawing from thousands of poems that have appeared in publications over the past 170 years, this paper explores these and other questions. I will read from many of these poems and comment on form, genre, textual linkages, and historical context."

Fowler	"SL02121, The term “Generation X” has been applied to the group of young adults now entering their mid-twenties to early forties. Coming of age after the highly idealistic 1960s but in the midst of the information revolution and a tremendous boom in popculture, this generation has proven difficult t ounderstand, especially with regard to faith and religiosity. To many, they seem to be a “generation adrift,” constantly searching but never quite finding the kind of secure home within church and institutiona lsettings as did many of their parents. Does this mean “Gen Xers” are not religious? Do they“lack faith”? Or is the iconoclasm and irreverence of much of today's pop culture a manifestation of a different kind of faith, a different set of needs that perhaps require a new syncretic form of spirituality? What can faith traditions do to attract and develop strong ties with members of this generation?James W. Fowler will reflect on these and other matters related to Generation X from sociological and experiential perspectives, correlating them reflectively with his own work in faith development theory."

Aside from its inherent condescension, its primary difficulty is the implication that men and women are naturally and universally attracted to very different kinds of movies. Actually, the mass marketers of pop trash pictures have become the new Hollywood tastemakers by influencing manufacture of similar formula fare for both sexes, although separately targeted to male and female audiences. “Dick flicks,” meanwhile, represents the egregious double standard of screen nudity where the penis is virtually never visible yet wields a disproportionate ghostly influence. (In the genre archetype, the 1986 Reagan-era war propaganda film, Top Gun, America's patriotic flyboys get erections going into battle.) This paper will discuss modern films that smash stereotypes and increase our understanding of gender while expanding a sense of community between men and women, as in two remarkable personal documentaries, Kate Davis's Southern Comfort and Utahan Paul Larsen's Chasing a Good Day to Die. Among other films examined are What Women Want, Ocean's 11, The Sweetest Thing, Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, The Importance of Being Earnest, My First Mister, I Am Sam, Kissing Jessica Stein, and The Son's Room."

Jess Groesbeck"	"The high rate of depression and prescription drug use in Utah strongly suggests some form of social pathology may exist that contributes to widespread emotional problems. These statistics seem incongruousin in the light of the positive correlation between Church affiliation, individual happiness, and family stability.

Brian Ferguson, Rebecca Chandler"	"SL02124, As told in the scriptures, the war in heaven was more than a simple story of the good guys defeating the bad guys. The fundamental issue was the question of agency versus compulsion. Are there forces in the Church today which are attempting to compel righteousness? Does it make a difference if these forces are motivated by love and concern for us?"

Is the refiner’s fire really necessary? More relevant, what do these problems, even large-scale calamities, do for us? Can they actually work to our benefit?"

Smith, Armand Mauss, Ken Driggs"	"SL02131, This panel explores the paradoxical situation of African-Americans within the Church since 1978 and the ambivalence about the roles assigned to blacks. As Church officials attempt to reach out to blacks through missionary efforts in predominantly black areas, many white Latter-day Saints continue to embrace and even promote certain racist concepts. How have these ideas affected the appeal of Mormonism among black Americans? How have African-American Mormons reacted to these developments?"

Blue Skying in the Literary Stratosphere	"Paul Swenson, Alex Caldiero, Gino Sky, Lynne Butler Oaks"	"SL02133, Fiction and poetry take a flyer in a stratosphere and at-risk level that demands correlation of heart, humor, and intellect. This session brings together for the first time the wildest writers of two states, Idaho's undomesticated Gino Sky and the irrepressible Alex Caldiero (Oeem via Sicily) and pairs them with poet Paul Swenson and award-winning fiction writer Lynne Butler Oaks."

Told primarily through the eyes of Joseph Lyman Jessop, a polygamist sent to Short Creek to help build “a branch of the Kingdom of God,” this story explores behind-the-scenes reasons this “refuge” so quickly, within three months' time, became such a focal point for Church, state, and national scrutiny. Original Mormonism, a fundamentalist's Understanding of the truths of Mormonism After years of researching various Mormon belief systems, Stan Shepp has combined the truths of all of these teachings into a synthesis he calls “Original Mormonism.” His vision ties together doctrines of the pre-existence, agency, government, priesthood, authority, plural celestial marriage, sealing power, the kingdom of God, the plan of salvation (including Adam-God), and our own personal eternal progression."

Lareena Smith	"SL02142, ""Polygamy and Me"" is a 14-minute documentary film made by Lareena Smith describing her own ten-year journey in and out of Mormon polygamy. Combining real photographs with dramatizations, it is a humorous look at daily life inside a polygamist marriage—full of ups and downs, jealousy, and odd moments.

These included the 1857 diary of Brigham Young's Indian interpreter, Wilford Woodruff's journal, and the LDS archives items Don Moormon used to write Camp Floyd and the Mormons. What turned up over the next five years proved astonishing: the lost “official” history of handcart veteran Josiah Rogerson; the letters of a forgotten Mormon hero, George Hicks; the narratives of adventurer James Gemmell and of John Hawley, “the Mormon Ulysses”; and “Discursive Remarks,” an account of the atrocity probably written by John D. Lee in 1859. While completing my study, I stumbled across a final piece of evidence that resolved all my remaining questions about what compelled decent men to commit a horrific crime."

While trying to retrieve the letter, I fell through the roof and broke a rib. This incident provides the controlling metaphor for my forthcoming book, The Rib Cage: the lush, edenic paradise of inland Taiwan; the rib, in this case, a broken rib, out of which woman is created; the fall; the knowledge it makes available; and the subsequent expulsion from the presence of God, as well as the growth made possible by that expulsion."

This presentation introduces elements of Middle Eastern history, his novel, and some suggestions for how to proceed in the current Middle East-Western conflict The focus in all these threads will be to help explore who we are, as individuals and Americans, in this world of ever-growing complexity."

Todd M. Compton, Vickie Stewart Eastman"	"SL02161, While traditional men’s organizations, such as clubs, corporations, the political process, law firms, and many churches, have given women full equality in our day, The Church of Jesus Christof Latter-day Saints continues to bar women from many significant leadership offices both at local and centralized levels.Yet ample evidence from the Old Testament, New Testament, and Church history supports a strong connection between women and priesthood. I will argue that recognizing women’s priesthood is the single most important institutional challenge faced by the Church today."

Edwards, Lavina Fielding Anderson"	"SL02162, Paul Edwards will address three aspects of Mormonism that attracted him to consider it as the basis for a tale of adventure and mayhem in his novel, The Angel Acronym (forthcoming, Signature Books). Lavina Fielding Anderson will present an overview of Mormon participation in crime fiction, identify ways in which Mormon elements lend themselves readily to this genre, and position Edwards's novel within that context."

While not usually thought of as a book of great romance, the bible provides answers, presenting an ideal for love so astounding that right now we don't dare imagine it. Beginning with God's intent in creation and elaborating on that intent in the Song of Solomon, adding in Jesus and some surprising advice from the Apostle Paul, this session reveals the bible's practical outline for a love that even the grave cannot destroy."

Ure"	"SL02164, This paper reports on my examination of 127 personal narratives of people who, for varied and complex reasons, have disassociated themselves from the Church. Of those under study, seventy-one percent had been lifetime members; sixty-two percent of males are returned missionaries; and of those married, over fifty percent are temple marriages. As I report my findings, I focus on three major themes: 1) the reasons given for leaving; 2) the process of leaving; and 3) their lives “after the Church.”"	SL02164	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL02164.mp3																				Recollecting God	"R. Dennis Potter, Brian Birch"	"SL02165, In this paper I argue that LDS theology provides us with an understanding of the nature of religious experience that allows for a philosophical defense of the “argument from religious experience.” This argument states that one can be justified in belief in God on the basis of one's religious experiences. The two main problems with this argument are (i) that it is possible that such experiences are illusory and (ii) that people of different religions often come to conflicting conclusions on the basis of their respective experiences. I will argue that religious experience is recollection, or, at least, epistemically similar to memory."

The panel will address questions such as: What percentage of missionaries return early? Why do missionaries who are given an honorable release for medical reasons still feel stigmatized? Should missionaries who return early simply because they dislike the work be granted an honorable release? Would it help to admit more openly the conflicts and frustrations of missionary service? Are the problems of an early return different for women than for men? What services and supports are in place for those who return early?"

Stuy"	"SL02173, The Deuteronomist De-Christianizing of the Old Testament KEVIN CHRISTENSEN, B.A., English, San Jose State University. In a 1980 Sunstone article, Melodie Moench Charles described “The Mormon Christianizing of the Old Testament,” citing several “distinguishing features of the Old Testament theology” that are “relatively consistent and are irreconcilable with Mormon commentary on the Old Testament.” Following the groundbreaking work of Margaret Barker, I challenge Charles's conclusions, and argue that “what is recognizable in Old Testament temple theology is what we know as Christianity.” Isaiah As a Lens to the Other Books of the Old Testament RICHARD DELEWSKI, social worker, University of Utah. Much has been written on Isaiah's content and literary style. Using this rich literary content, this paper explores what contributions and insights Isaiah brings to the other major books of the Old Testament.

Sarah Barringer Gordon	"SL02191, In the 150 years since Mormon leaders publicly announced that the faithful believed in and practiced plural marriage, neither “the Mormon Question” nor the societal issues that are raised when any group undertakes to practice laws that fall outside traditional moral or ethical boundaries have really gone away. In this dynamic, multi-media presentation,nationally honored historian and law professor Sarah Barringer Gordon will discuss the constitutional issues and theories about what makes a “civilized”society that have been influenced by the practice of plural marriage. How have laws and paradigms changed as polygamy—one of the “twin relics of barbarism” (slavery is the other)—and those who practice it have become better understood? What might the future hold?

The first is an unusual interpretation of the parable of the good Samaritan offered anciently by Origen, an early church Father. The second is the story told in John 21 of the post-resurrection appearance of Jesus to Peter and several other disciples at the Sea of Tiberias."

Wilcox"	"SL02212, One way to understand the symbolism of the Nauvoo Temple is to consider its central duality—the physical and spiritual. Perhaps the most basic symbol of the duality is the timeless dyad of sun and moon—easily seen in the Nauvoo Temple’s pairing of sunstone and moonstone. The enigmatic sunstone of the Nauvoo Temple held, and might once again ascend to a position of prominence in the architecture of a new religion. But what of the moonstone? The sunstone and moonstone were linked together as pedestal and capital of one pilaster—making a balanced construction, one integral whole. What can we learn from these cosmological symbols?"

Clive Scott Chisholm	"SL02213, Scott Chisholm will read a chapter from his forthcoming book, Following the Wrong God Home: Walking An American Dream (University of Oklahoma Press). He will reflect on his personal experiences as he walked the Mormon Trail from Winter Quarters to Salt Lake City—alone."

Since the Book of Mormon clearly states that all sacrifices have their end with Jesus' “great and last” sacrifice, is it puzzling that Joseph Smith would have found such a restoration necessary? This paper explores the history and theology behind Smith's thinking and ways it was supported by creative reinterpretations of scripture."

Blanchard, Marylee Mitcham"	"SL02215, This paper explores Christ's answer to Pharisees who tried to pin him down by asking him to select which of their thousands of laws was the most important. What does Christ's definition of the First Commandment mean in our lives? What is love? How does God operate through love? How can we be instruments of love?"

Olsen	"SL02216, The Malay Peninsula has many striking similarities to geographical descriptions in the Book of Mormon. Could it actually be the location of Book of Mormon events? Evidence to support this hypothesis includes: a north-south orientation, a genuine narrow neck of land, animals, grains, vegetables, languages, metallurgy, weapons, tools, Israelite beliefs, and much more."

Surprised, she called the local ACLU office to ask if they could use a volunteer and, before long, became the chapter's director of development and then executive director. This past April, she announced her retirement, effective at the end of 2002. Among other cases, Gnade has guided ACLU campaigns regarding the sale of a block of Salt Lake City's Main Street to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; equal access for the Gay/Straight Alliance, a student club at a Salt Lake City high school; the case of Wendy Weaver, an educator who was told she couldn't speak truthfully about who she is when it was learned (in a conversation outside of the classroom) that she is a lesbian; and she has also worked behind the scenes with four Utah executions. We know you will enjoy meeting Carol and hearing her reflect on her extraordinary experiences trying to safeguard individual freedoms in this most interesting and church-dominated state."

Russell, Neal Chandler"	"SL02222, The men who have led the LDS and RLDS churches have the dual and often contradictory roles of “prophet” and “president.” W. Grant McMurray, RLDS (now Community of Christ) president since 1996, has suggested that his denomination should think of itself as a “prophetic church” and not merely a “church with a prophet.” This paper will examine what he might mean, looking especially at the church’s struggle over the past fifty years with issues of discrimination."

Talmage was a very complex man, brilliant, in mind, expansive in spirit. This paper explores several themes in Elder Talmage's life and work, including the bridge he was able to build between his intellect and spirit; the role that President John Taylor played in his life as well as other early LDS intellectuals; and the stories behind Elder Talmage's work on the book Latter-day Revelation and his tobacco use during the writing of Jesus the Christ."

Reed Murdock	"SL02224, One of the better known stories in Church history is the simultaneous birth of twins in the homes of Joseph and Emma Smith and John and Julia Clapp Murdock on 30 April 1831. After the death of both Smith twins and of Julia Clapp Murdock (from complications while giving birth), Joseph and Emma adopted the Murdock twins. After the infamous mob attack which left Joseph Smith tarred and feathered, one of the twins, Joseph Murdock Smith, died, leaving Julia as the only survivor of the four twins.

Stevens"	"SL02225, Many well-intentioned people are unaware of how central issues of race are to their lives. This session will try to help facilitate a new understanding of racism, i.e., that racism is not just about committing individual acts of aggression but rather is a consciousness situated in a long history of oppression and discrimination. The presentation's main focus, however, will be to help Latter-day Saints understand ways in which they might develop greater Christlike love and become more consciously anti-racist."

Jeff Burton"	"SL02226, Since the events of 11 September, I have had several opportunities to mourn. I've mourned with my friends and fellow Americans who lost loved ones in the terrorist attacks. I've mourned with colleagues, friends, and ward members who have lost loved ones from more natural causes. I've also mourned with friends over the loss of their faith. Before these experiences, I tended to ignore Alma's admonition that Christians must be willing to “mourn with those that mourn.” Nowadays, I find the act of mourning to be my most perfect expression of love, worship, and discipleship, an act free from moral ambiguity."

Rex Sears, Paul Tinker, Ken Driggs, Sarah Barringer Gordon"	"SL02231, While many Latter-day Saints know about polygamy and its importance in Mormon doctrine and history, few know about its effects on the world outside of Mormonism. As Sarah Barringer Gordon writes, polygamy had a profound influence on constitutional law and political theory that left a powerful legacy on religious life, that is, “Americans are free to believe, but they may well not be free to act on their beliefs.” Panelists will discuss her book, The Mormon Question."

How Racism Affects Identity in the Church and Community	"Margaret Toscano, Natalie Palmer Sheppard, Sarah Smith, Yvette Donosso Diaz"	"SL02234, This panel will explore how racial identity affects the way LDS women relate to and are able to participate in the Church community. Women representing minority groups in the Church will take a personal approach, describing their experiences, struggles, and concerns. Questions to be explored include: How big a problem is racism within the LDS Church institution and membership? How can we recognize when we are participating in this problem? What are some positive ways to work toward healing? What does it mean for all to be “alike unto God”? Should this be our goal? How can we honor and encourage differences while working toward equality?"

Fascinating evidence continues to come to light supporting a North American Book of Mormon geography. This evidence includes the discovery of copper mines in Northern Michigan, coins with Hebrew script located in Kentucky and Missouri, and a stone with the Ten Commandments carved in Hebrew, found in Ohio. This evidence and other significant discoveries will be discussed."

Since his death, many have had the opportunity to share thoughts and memories of Gene in special issues of several LDS publications, but chances to tell stories and remember him in a communal setting have been rare.

Murphy, Bill Bradshaw"	"SL02251, Are concepts that sinfulness is reflected in skin color consistent with biogenetic understandings of human variation? Are patriarchal concepts of a procreative seed consistent with modern biogenetic procreation? Is Israelite heritage of Nephites and Lamanites reflected in the genes and biology of Native Americans? I will argue that new scientific evidence indicates we should relegate these folk biological concepts to the realm of 'mistakes of men.'"

Miller, Robert Beckstead"	"SL02253, Emanuel Swedenborg, born 1688, taught that the world of spirits is a preparation for heaven, there are three heavens, marriage is necessary to inherit the holiest of the heavens, the celestial kingdom is divided into three heavens, and there is a balance (opposition) in all things. Such unique and unusual similarities in the teachings of Swedenborg and Joseph Smith naturally prompt one to wonder if Swedenborg influenced LDS doctrine. This paper will analyze the evidence."

Viewing Mother through the lens of iconography, I suggest that the Church's move to designate her as “sacred” is an iconoclastic act that dissociates her from Mormon collective memory. Given Mother's significance in Mormon cosmology, why has she disappeared from our discourse and become so “sacred” that she is unknowable? What consequences would follow from making her more central to our daily discourse?"

"Paul H. Smith, Dan Vogel"	"SL02256, Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon (according to some accounts) by burying his face in a hat with a “seerstone.” Skeptics think such methods undermine Joseph's claim to legitimacy as a prophet, while apologists try to reconcile the apparent facts in a faith-preserving way. Calling on personal experience in a U.S. government remote viewing program, I discuss Smith's translating method as an “inspired version” of the ancient practice of scrying and argue that, despite detractors, the prophet was on the right track."

She called for greater honesty, humility, courage, and compassion from both scholars and the Church. As measured by desired results, that paper was spectacularly unsuccessful. Firings at BYU, excommunications, disfellowshippings, a heightened level of fear, increased pressure on Sunstone, and the virtual demise of Mormon feminism followed. This paper will recall that initial 1992 presentation, analyze the environment for scholarship in the Church over the past decade, and indulge in some “what ifs.”"	SL02261	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL02261.mp3																				Life With The 'Unchosen People'	"Rebecca Salti, J.

Drawing on both pro- and anti-Mormon sources, this presentation will replicate, through dramatic reading and commentary, some of the more inflammatory newspaper wars of the day. The star of this show will be the young George Q.

The result was a large number of converts who mostly left the Church. Are there still scars from this policy? How do converts from this period feel? How about the members called to visit them?

Immediately, rumors circulated that the book was a response to several forthcoming publications on the massacre. Chief among these, it was speculated, is Will Bagley's Blood of the Prophets: Brigham Young and the Mountain Meadows Massacre.

Paul Larsen	"SL02266, In 1995, Latter-day Saints Paul and Ann Larsen found themselves in the middle of the kind of nightmare parents dread most. Their fifteen-year-old son, Erik, was in a deep depression that two years of counseling and anti-depressant medications were unable to alleviate. As they watched their son slipping away, they went searching for something—anything—that might help him. To their surprise, both Erik and Paul (who had experienced his own loss of hope) found renewal and a healing that continues to this day through their participation in native American curing ceremonies that included the use of sweat lodges and peyote.""Chasing a Good Day to Die"" primarily chronicles Paul’s journey on the “Medicine Path” that for so long has guided Native Americans to greater spiritualityand transformation. It sets in context the recent battles over the legality of peyote for use in Native American ceremonies, but most powerfully, it follows the stories of many people whose lives, like Erik’s and Paul’s, have been undeniably turned around by their participation in these ceremonies. Paul Larsen will introduce the film before the screening (which will continue through the end of this scheduled hour), and a discussion of the film will follow during the next time block (See session#276)."

Many who leave the Church consider themselves to be not lost sheep, not enemies of the truth, but seekers who feel truth can be discovered down another path. How can orthodox Mormons respect the vision such people have? Given that many have friends and family members who are still devout, and that their past understandings were shaped by Mormonism, how much should people who don't believe Mormon theology be expected to divorce themselves from Mormon culture? Is it possible to leave the Church and still respect its members and its gifts to its members? This panel seeks to explore balanced answers to these questions."

Dennis Potter, Phillip Gordon, Ryan Robinson, Errin Julkunen, Kathryn Tew"	"SL02273, In Spring 2002, Dennis Potter and Phillip Gordon taught the first Mormon Cultural Studies class at Utah Valley State College in Orem, Utah. Cultural Studies (CS) is the field that explains how various aspects of culture (such as music, media, and literature, etc.) are used to uphold or undermine relationships of power in society. When applied to Mormonism, CS can deal with the cultural aspects of anti-Mormonism as well as internal aspects of Mormon culture. In this panel, Potter and Gordon will discuss what they have learned about teaching such a course at a state school. Several students from the class will also summarize their experience in the class and its impact on their own thinking."

Paulsen, which appeared inside. Still, of all the theological challenges that dominate philosophy of religion, “theodicy,” often called the “problem of evil,” seems in the minds of many Latter-day Saints to be less troubling than it is for more traditional theistic traditions. Why is this so? In this follow-up session to one presented at last year's symposium, panelists will examine LDS approaches to the problem of evil in conversation with the work of “process theologians,” thinkers who are working to apply the seminal insights of Alfred North Whitehead to religious questions and themes. What can Latter-day Saints learn from the work of process theologians? Can we develop our theological first principles to match the sophistication of their analyses and proposed solutions? Where might Mormon approaches to theodicy be stronger? Can the problem of evil ever be “solved”?"

Kimball, Rebecca Chandler"	"SL02277, A recent book, More Than One: A Sacred Heritage, A Promise for Tomorrow, by Shane Whelan, has initiated a new conversation among faithful Latter-day Saints about the practice of plural marriage. Most studies of Mormon polygamy have focused on its history and scope, have been sociological treatises about its contemporary practice among fundamentalist Mormons, or have been written from advocacy positions either praising or condemning its many forms. Whelan's book is different, for he writes from a confessional position as an active Latter-day Saint who believes that polygamy is a “true and pure principle that will once again be practiced among the Saints as part of the restoration of the fullness of the gospel and in preparation for the Savior's Second Coming.” Whelan adds caveats, of course: it should only be resumed when it is no longer against the law of the land and only when the Lord commands its reinstatement through the Church's recognized prophet. Is plural marriage as Whelan sees it? It is true that the Church has never condemned the principle, only its practice, but does that mean plural marriage is an eternal law? Will Latter-day Saints from this or future generations, like those in earlier times, be called upon to live “the Principle”? Is plural marriage a requirement for exaltation in the celestial kingdom, or was it a commandment only for nineteenth-century Saints? Are the doctrines and justifications given for the earlier practice of polygamy valid? Hear our panelists, and consider what you might say or do if Church members are once more encouraged to enter into the practice!"

Compton"	"SL02311, Researchers who have tried to determine which and how many women Joseph Smith married agree on one thing: he had at least thirty plural wives. But how does a young man, a husband and father of three children, in the space of three years, find thirty women to marry? And how would the LDS community receive a polygamous prophet in the 21st Century?"	SL02311	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL02311.mp3																				Mormonism and Its Two Ultimates	"James McLachlan, Benjamin Huff"	"SL02312, The assertion that there are two ultimates provides a basis for dialogue between two basic kinds of religious experience: the experience of the ultimate in a personal and impersonal form. I think this notion of two ultimates is a particularly fruitful one for theological interpretations of LDS doctrine, with its emphasis on freedom and persons. In this respect, it may be that the LDS notion of God bears a resemblance to Mahayana Buddhist understanding of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas as human beings who have become perfect through their compassion for suffering creatures. I argue further that it may be more helpful for Latter-day Saint theologians and philosophers to look to other traditions for help in interpreting Mormon revelation than to look solely to the theistic tradition which has often been hostile to anything like LDS theism."

Frederick ""Toby"" Pingree"	"SL02313, Today the Church places great emphasis on the idea that the doctrines and teachings of its leaders are consistent with scripture and revealed principles. But a study of General Conference discourses (the established forum for declaring doctrine) and other authoritative pronouncements shows many contradictions between the teachings of the leaders themselves. What can be learned from these disagreements and about the leaders who spoke them? Can any patterns be found that place these differences into context?"

Then, in two discourses delivered in his final months, he again made significant modifications to the first verse of Genesis. This paper compares Joseph's differing versions of the creation story, first with one another, and then with the text of Genesis as it existed at the time of Jesus, as witnessed by the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Samaritan Pentateuch, and the Greek Septuagint. Do any of Smith's changes find ancient textual support? What can current methods of textual and redaction criticism tell us about what Smith was doing?"

Kimball as Public Speaker This paper presents a historical context and critique of President Spencer W. Kimball as public speaker and rhetorician, as manifest in his General Conference addresses as Church president from 1973â€“1985. By analyzing his speaking style, preparation, and organization, it becomes clear that President Kimball did not fit the traditional model of oratorical effectiveness. He was, nevertheless, able to profoundly affect Mormonism during his tenure as president."

Bonner Ritchie has been a longtime teacher and consultant on the Middle East ? with governments, ministers, reporters, and even the Palestinian Liberation Organization. In this guided conversation, he will share his insights into the current crisis in Israel, especially with regard to the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Can we realistically hope for peace? Who will be the likely leaders of a truly lasting peace accord? How might we in the U.S. help? Has Yassar Arafat lost all of his credibility as a player in the peace process?"

I have now completed my study which includes findings from many additional interviews and more fully developed conclusions. I will briefly present the results, but I hope mostly that we'll be able to have a great discussion together. Come see if and how your experiences connect with those of the women in this study."

Looking Back on Mission Experiences I've recently reread my mission journal, and the experience led me to deconstruct some of its implications. I have had to ask: Was my mission successful, and how does one measure such a thing? Of what value has my mission experience been to me personally, now nearly half-a-century later?"

Arrington Collection		"SL02331, Reflections on Who Owns a People's History: The Controversy of the Leonard J. Arrington Collection In 2001, the Leonard J. Arrington collection was opened to the public at the Utah State University Special Collections division. Within days, however, Church representatives questioned whether documents donated by Arrington were actually owned by the Church. The situation quickly degenerated and polarized both parties until it was resolved amicably by Church president Gordon B. Hinckley and USU president Kermit Hall. This panel will discuss this incident, but more importantly, the issues it raises for the future."

Celebrating Signature Books and Its Contribution to Mormon Studies Signature Books celebrates twenty years of publishing books, sometimes groundbreaking, sometimes controversial, often-times both. With works including Mormon theology, LDS history, humor, fiction, social critiques, music, personal essays, and other topics, the Signature Books publishing library has become impressive indeed.

"SL02335, Is Progressive Political Activism Supported by Mormon Theology? Mormons for Equality and Social Justice (mesj) is a grassroots organization of Latter-day Saints that are working towards economic and social justice. A panel of mesj participants will speak about how LDS teachings or their experiences confronting the suffering of others have inspired them to become “anxiously engaged” in causes such as women's issues, workers rights, poverty, and the environment."

These books were avidly received by women, yet the books' creators encountered Church disapproval. Still, the books have continued to have an impact. A Daughter of Zion was reprinted in 1999 and Women and Authority is the top-selling women's title at Signature Books. Why do such books generate both appeal and controversy? Why aren't there more books like these? What do these books tell us about Mormon feminism today?"

In this paper, I will explain how and why I came to write his biography, the special problems I faced as a non-Mormon in treating his life and work, and how I resolved them. I will also speak about Joseph's personality and character, as I understand them, and explain why I believe he elicited such savage hatred from many of his contemporaries and undying devotion from others."

This paper focuses on FARMS' own research concerning the historicity and divinity of the Book of Mormon, specifically its conclusions about textual chiasma and Hebraisms and its thesis for a Mesoamerican setting for Book of Mormon events. Using solely internal evidence from the Book of Mormon, I will challenge FARMS' arguments in each of these areas."

They were, for example, the only non-Mormons ever elected to the presidency of the Association for Mormon Letters, a position which Sesh (as Candadai is affectionately known) filled a decade ago and which Neila was preparing to assume at the time of her death in March 2002. This conversation with Sesh will elicit his reflections on their early lives in India, their Hinduism, and their many friendships and adventures among the Mormons."	SL02354	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL02354.mp3																				The Making of the Nauvoo Sunstones		"SL02355, The Making of the Nauvoo Sunstones Like human genealogy, the ancestry of the Nauvoo sunstones is complex and its sources in history are ramified. The sunstones' character as a religious icon depended much on the universality of its imagery. But its authors also relied on known sources which they hoped would reverberate in the minds of early Latter-day Saints. These sources included ancient European heraldry, New England gravestone carving, Roman sculpture, and Freemasonry. Through narrative and a slide presentation, Whittle will present these various traditions constituting the sunstone's historical context, the ways in which these sources were blended, a brief discussion of the nature of religious symbolism, and a limited review of early Mormon symbology in general."

Many of its most controversial articles have, in time, proved beneficial to the Church. Why then, is Dialogue often defined in words ranging from “dissident,” to “anti-Mormon”? If these definitions are legitimate, has Dialogue shifted from its original vision? Or is it too often misunderstood? Over the past eight years I have interviewed all former Dialogue editors as part of my research for a four-part history of the journal. Using examples from various articles and the controversies they've addressed (and, at times, caused!), I will share my conclusions. Has Dialogue helped or hurt the Kingdom?"

Now that we have “won” the war in Afghanistan and are considering expanding the campaign to other theaters, perhaps it would be wise for us to pause and ask exactly what it means to declare a “war on terrorism” and what perspectives the prophets and scriptures offer us on war. If, as the D&C states, the day will come when Zion will be the only place one can flee for safety and the Latter-day Saints “the only people that shall not be at war,” perhaps we should begin thinking about how to create the conditions that would make this possible."

Cora's case played a part in the Smoot hearings in Washington, furnished a battleground in Utah's newspaper wars, and divided a family. This paper puts a woman's face on the abstract issues of both land law and church discipline in an era when two clashing systems were working out an uneasy coexistence."

It was Christmastime. We'd been receiving cards from friends with letters and notes about how their families were growing and achieving. And I thought, “How do I write to someone and say, ‘Things are not going well in my family'? How do I admit that my child is not growing and achieving? I don't know what's wrong, and I can barely get through the days physically and psychologically.” So I simply stopped writing. Now, fifteen years after my son's death, perhaps I can start writing again and share some of the powerful effects he had on my life."

"SL02365, 'Why Have Ye Polluted the Holy Church of God?' 2,500 years ago, Nephi cautioned those living in our day against being “lulled away into carnal security,” believing “all is well in Zion” and putting our trust in the precepts of any men rather than the Holy Ghost. A thousand years later, Moroni reiterated these concerns, focusing on the theme of polluted churches and asking “Why have ye polluted the Holy Church of God?” This paper examines the views of various Mormon scholars on the question, “What is this 'Holy Church of God'“ and of what importance is it to Latter-day Saints today?"

It's about time this intractable, cantankerous, perspicacious, and erudite 92-year-old “gets as good as he has given.” Who knows? Maybe Hugh will even give a little more of it back this very evening.

Richard Rorty	"SW03001, Science and religion are often said to be irreconcilable. Are they? Can believers be intellectually responsible? Do they need to be? How strong, really, is the demand that religious faith submit to the authority of the empirical? Does that demand make science just another “god of power” for us to worship? Are there other ways to view faith so its ultimate obligation is not to correspond with the intrinsic nature of reality. but with other criteria such as the obligation to love?"

In the case of the parable of the Good Samaritan, I find many implications for issues such as race, finances, taxes, health insurance, temple, priesthood, orthodoxy, and love. Besides encouraging us to practice opportunistic and down- to-earth compassion, this parable subtly undercuts those who rely on narrowly viewed “orthodoxy” and offers a surprisingly stinging critique of those who focus on a spiritless experience with priesthood and the temple. I believe the parable calls us to radically redefine priesthood and temple worship as first and foremost centering on compassion. The session closes with an extended anti-Republican rant."

If he says the Church provides a Gospel Essentials class, tell him the people you have in mind are returned missionaries, and former members of Relief Society and priesthood quorum presidencies who would not be well-suited for an investigator’s forum: a re-investigator’s class, yes, but not the type given those who are meeting the Church for the first time. The Catholic Church in my area recently ran newspaper ads inviting inactive Catholics to the priest’s home and stating, “any questions are welcome.” I have since collected much information about “Re-membering Catholics” courses and talked to several local LDS leaders about hosting something similar for inactive Mormons. So far, they have not been enthusiastic. I will present some of the Catholic materials and  responses I’ve received. How could these ideas be tweaked to fit this important need within Mormonism?"

This session focuses on the story of this book, it’s author, publishing history, and the many ways it outshines the indexes in today’s LDS scriptures as well as electronic search engines."

Some say we’ve lost ground over the years and are discouraged. Come join in a guided discussion/strategy meeting to discuss Mormon feminism, the issues we explore, and what we can do to rejuvenate. Some questions to start the discussion: • What issues still engage us? • What issues move us to action/activism/advocacy? • If you had only one ounce of strength left, which issue would it go to? • Which issues have you stopped flogging or given up on?

Rees, Janet Brigham Rands"	"SW03035, For several years, I’ve been examining various challenges to Joseph Smith’s claim that he translated the Book of Mormon through the gift and power of God. In this third installment, I examine the theory some naturalist critics have turned to as a more rational explanation: that it was the product of “automatic” or “spirit” writing, similar to  the processes said to have produced such works as the Course in Miracles and the Urantia Book. In this paper, I examine the Book of Mormon in relation to the phenomenon  of automatic writing as well as new scientific explorations of communication from the spirit world."

And feeling that such things are culturally “unhip” is not a good reason for ignoring this essential task. How can we instill the values we cherish and even find a place for activity in organized religion—the “gathering church”—even when we disagree with much taught there?

It identifies challenges facing Latter-day Saint communities in light of recent advances from the biological sciences. Is the Book of Mormon’s assumption that skin color reflects sinfulness consistent with biogenetic understandings of human physical variation? Are Biblical and Book of Mormon images of a patriarchal seed transmitted from fathers to sons consistent with modern understandings of biogenetic procreation?

Snow"	"DC03011, Eugene England has called Hugh Nibley ìthe finest lay (in contrast to officially called) prophet of the Latter-day Saint people,î and has argued that Nibley ìmost perceptively describes our sins, most courageously and persistently calls us to repentance, and most accurately predicts our future if we will not repent.î England may be guilty of hyperbole, but most would agree that Hugh Nibley has had a gift for sizing up the spiritual state of society and the ability to call us to repentance in plain but sincere words. It is interesting to discover that he has had this gift since he was a teenager. Further, perhaps there is something for us to learn from Hughí's style of criticism: He has never been censured for his sometimes-biting words about the Mormon community. And although his influence has not been universally embraced by the Church, it has been deeply felt by many."

Baker, Dan Wotherspoon"	"DC03012, Liberal religion believes in a limited God, holds an optimistic view of human nature, and values reason as a source of religious information. Mormonism emerged in the nineteenth century primarily as a liberal religion. This tradition in Mormonism has been strong but has coexisted also with strong conservative elements. Recently, however, Mormonism has clearly become more identified with conservative religious elements that emphasize belief in an all-powerful God, distrust human nature, and value authority as the source of religious knowledge. As a Mormon raised in the liberal tradition, I chronicle this transformation through my personal experience and propose a religious stance and course of action that might resurrect and advance Mormonismís liberal religious tradition."

It demands that we recognize our moral outrage over unthinkable crimes and squarely face that part of ourselves that wants to lash out and punish evildoers. For others, the call of Christianity---óthat we love our neighbors as ourselves and even learn to love (not kill) our enemies---ótakes center stage in their reasoning. Many of us also have a strong desire to believe our government is acting upon good information and sound moral principles and hope to answer the call of ìgood citizenship î (however ambiguous that may be).

For similar reasons, most Latter-day Saints usually think the same of their Churchís past. During the lifetime of founder Joseph Smith, however, Mormonism was a violent religious subculture within a violent national culture, and the Us-Them boundaries were often blurred.

Similarly, contemporary Mormon prophets have ambitiously adopted todayí's digital telecommunications technologies. So ì""wired""î is the Church that digital technologies are now integrated into the heart of our worship and sacred rituals.

Carlos Museum in Atlanta purchased a collection of Egyptian artifacts, including ten coffins and nine mummies, formerly owned by ìThe Niagara Falls Museum and Daredevil Hall of Fame.î Recent research confirms four of these mummies had apparently been purchased by the Niagara Falls Museum from the Wood'ís Museum in Chicago in 1878--óseven years after the Chicago fire of 1871 supposedly destroyed the Woodí's Museumís entire Egyptian collection. It is well known that  the Woodí's Museum owned two of the mummies formerly owned by Joseph Smith, as well as a portion of the Egyptian papyri associated with the Book of Abraham that was not part of the ìdiscoveryî at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1967. So, are two of Smithí's mummies now in the Carlos Museum? I'íll examine the evidence.

The release of Brigham City the following year cemented his place as the founding father of ""Mormon Cinema.” But as others have followed Dutcher in making LDS-themed films, their movies haven’t achieved the same sort of cross-over and critical success his films have enjoyed. Why haven’t films such as The Singles Ward, Charlie, Out of Step, The RM, and The Other Side of Heaven had the same impact? Perhaps one of the main answers lies in the way Dutcher approaches the task of storytelling. The implications of his approach and of his vision reach well beyond filmmaking."

That leaves a lot of us feeling like there’s something wrong with our belief system or with those we care for. Palmer, whose book The Tabernacle Bar ricochets between the miraculous and the morally disturbing, describes a safe zone, a healthy balance between faith and doubt that she’s taken to calling “Benediction Alley.”"	NW03005	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/NW03005.mp3																				PILLARS OF MY FAITH	"Robert Kayihura, Leah Smith, Dan Pingree"	"NW03006, “Pillars” is traditionally one of the most popular sessions at Sunstone symposiums.

The novelists, both Mormon and non-Mormon, have developed stories that hinge on something to do with our history and/or culture. How much do they reflect what we really are, and how much is total fiction? Do novels, in some way, come closer to describing who we are as a people than do scholarly studies?"

Briggs	"DA03004, In exploring issues of violence on the Mormon frontier, most historians employ a ""top-down"" theoretical approach, focusing on Mormon elites such as Joseph Smith, Sidney  Rigdon, and Brigham Young. They evaluate the impact of Mormonism’s leading opinion-makers on the Mormon masses. Most recently, Will Bagley has employed this approach in Blood of the Prophets, his study of the Mountain Meadows Massacre, and Bagley believes he’s created a compelling case for Brigham Young’s actions being a direct cause of the  massacre. While a top-down approach is certainly an appropriate one, I believe a more complete view of violence and disorder on the Mormon frontier, and the Mountain Meadows Massacre, emerges as we also employ a ""bottom-up"" methodology. I will present the outlines of this kind of approach and how ethnic and cultural studies illuminate nuances to this  tragedy that Bagley and others have heretofore missed."

In researching a major article published in the 21 February 2004 Salt Lake Tribune, reporters Peggy Fletcher Stack and Linda Fantin interviewed dozens of scholars about this wave of interest in Mormon Studies among universities and scholarly presses and their thoughts on how best to approach the academic study of Mormonism.

Not only is it ironic that such ideas should be adduced to explain retrospectively the ban, but it is also very damaging to the conversion and retention of potential new members of color.

In 1848, the Mormon Battalion was the first ever to akte wagons over the route. In 1851, the largest emigrant company ever, 437 people, traveled the trail to found San Bernardino, with many others following later.

Does this have implications for women’s place or roles in Christianity today? And what does it mean for Mormonism as the “restoration” of original Christianity?

It was an interesting attempt to encompass the entire gospel plan, from pre- mortality to the afterlife. there was a long dry period for LDS novels after that, with the form resurfacing in the 1940s and ‘50s. But the novels were few and far between until the ‘70s when Mormon love stories began to grow in popularity. Now Mormons are featured in hundreds of novels published by both regional and national houses. Is our religion and culture accurately reflected in this burgeoning literary form?"

The man for all seasons, author of Utopia, Sir Thomas More defended Catholicism and attacked Lutheran heretic William Tyndale, the brilliant linguist who single-handedly translated most of the Bible. Interestingly, many of their topics are the very issues many Latter-day Saints still discuss with passion: the true church, apostasy, continuous revelation, closed vs. open scriptures, faith vs. works, free agency, what is a testimony, women and the priesthood, church discipline, obedience and dissent."

DEALING WITH FAMILY CRISIS IN 1886: THE DEATH OF CHARLEY WHITNEY AND THE MARRIAGE OF GEN WHITNEY	"Todd Compton, Robert H. Briggs"	"SW04053,The diaries of Helen Mar Whitney contain many prosaic days. But they also include moments of high drama, starting with the grueling, beautifully described death of Helen’s husband by dropsy in 1884.  When Charles Whitney, Helen’s teenage son, shot himself in 1886, Helen again recorded the event in detail in her journal, a harrowing few pages. Almost as traumatic to Helen was her daughter Gen’s marriage to a non-Mormon later that year. In both these events, Helen grappled with existential agony, then tried to make sense of the experience through her perception of the gospel."

Quiring"	"SW04055, Recent discussions of the diversity of religions have centered on three stances toward another’s religion—exclusivity, inclusivity, and plurality—and I have found examples of Mormons who approach other religions through each of those lenses. But my larger goal in this paper is to outline a new approach to interacting with other religions that suggests ways that the faiths involved can be enriched through dialogue and mutual critique much like partners are in a growing, evolving, marital love."

If one considers such crimes as being related to a community’s socialization to obedience and sacrifice, it is important to examine the shared LDS myths that reinforce members’ understandings and expectations regarding these elements of belief and practice. The Church claims to be a restoration and fulfillment of the Abrahamic covenant; therefore, it is important to discuss LDS language of Abrahamic obedience and sacrifice and ask what are the implications of such discourse for LDS women and children."

Fowler’s attempt to define human  spiritual development as it relates to the human maturation process has greatly affected my thinking, my faith, and my understanding of my fellow Latter-day Saints.

A fourth case study examines dispossession and forfeiture of rights among the Mormons in the same era. Was nineteenth-century territorial Utah a “colonial site,” and in what ways does a postcolonial approach illuminate political, economic, cultural, literary, and religious issues between America’s cultural elites and the Latter-day Saints?"

Rees, Wade Major, Miles Romney"	"SW04065, Mel Gibson’s The Passion of the Christ is destined to become one of the most viewed as well as one of the most controversial movies in the history of film. Some have hailed it as “a film of overwhelming  power and passion” which “draws us toward Christ’s full humanity like no film before” and as “a bold statement of faith” “through which God has spoken.” Others have characterized the film as “anti-Semitic,” sadomasochistic,” “pornographic,” “one of the cruelest movies in the history of the cinema,” and “a gory bloodbath.”Does Mormonism’s unique theology of the atonement and its access to modern scriptures about Christ gives Latter-day Saints a unique perspective on this film? Are Mormons as polarized as other believers about this presentation of Christ’s last hours? Given that Gibson’s film will be seen by an astonishing number of viewers worldwide, what is likely to be its influence and legacy?"

Tepaske, Kristy Coleman"	"SW04071, Last year, The DaVinci Code swept other books aside in sales as well as cultural impact. The plot consumed readers while its esoteric information piqued widespread curiosity and its religious themes struck a universal nerve—with the divine feminine, hidden in history, art, and culture, now emerging from obscurity. The book sparked a mass infatuation with Mary Magdalene and secret, heretical traditions—esoteric Christian, Gnostic, hermetic, pagan, templar, and Grail mysteries. The result is that a Medieval heresy has reached a 21st-century critical mass, creating a Magdalene zeitgeist. Yet how reliable are the book’s ideas?

Most of these initiatives and efforts remain unknown to most LDS members. Two  of the leaders most intimately involved in these programs will share their experiences and identify both successes and obstacles encountered in their efforts to promote fuller and more comfortable relationships among ethnic and racial groups in and out of the Church."

This panel seeks to examine Krakauer’s depiction of fundamentalist Mormonism, mainstream Latter-day Saints, and Ron and Dan  Lafferty, two brothers who murdered their sister-in-law and niece after claiming a revelation from God.

COPING IN THE MORMON BORDERLANDS: THE PRICE OF OPENNESS & THE 'PHENOMENON OF THE CLOSEST DOUBTER' REVISITED	"Jared Christensen, D. Jeff Burton"	"SW04074, Last fall, I wrote an essay, published in Sunstone, that detailed my struggle for testimony. In it, I discuss how my desire for truth led me into the dark side of Church history, causing a battle between my  intellect and my spiritual ties to the Church. I also discuss how I’ve been affected by the dishonest dealings of some Church leaders concerning the Mark Hofmann bombings, which claimed the life of my father,  Steve Christensen. Despite the “costs” of writing that essay, the blessings that have come are far greater. In this session, I discuss the pros and cons of opening up to those around me, including my experience  with being made a scapegoat and used as a negative example to my missionary peers in the Ohio Columbus Mission.      SW04074, Mormons are expected to gain a “testimony” of the unique religious tenets of the Church. This expectation is so prevalent that those not able to testify to having such “knowledge” inevitably feel marginalized, unworthy, and suspect in the eyes of believers. One peculiar response to this expectation has  been the creation of a group of Mormons I call “closet doubters,” active members of the Church who either pretend to “know,” or who remain silent and secretive about their plight. In this session, we will explore the reasons for this curiosity and the problems that confront closet doubters. I particularly invite those from faiths other than Mormonism to share their experiences. Does a similar phenomenon arise in other traditions?"

How have some wrestled with their faith and yet still emerged more determined than ever to be a part of the Latter-day Saint  community?"

Is it at fertilization (penetration of sperm into ovum)? Implantation (of previous free-floating embryo into uterine lining)? Individuation (cell specialization around day fourteen)? Ability to live outside the womb (around twenty-four weeks)? First breath? This question is just one of many issues which animate the current debate about the ethics of stem cell research.

The resultant racial speculations of nineteenth-century American Protestants continue to be prominently distributed among Latter-day Saints today. Why is  that, especially given our emphasis on continuing revelation and the dozens of latter-day scriptures that preach a universal God and gospel? This session examines how the new scholarship and an understanding of pre-1960s U.S. laws regarding citizenship, immigration, and hypodescent help explain the phenomenon of Mormonism’s continuing folklore, and provide support for ending it."

Roberts	John Sillito	"NW04004, Though he has been dead for seventy years, B. H. Roberts remains a significant Mormon historian and theologian, and is considered one of the Church’s premier  intellectuals. Though best known for his writings, Roberts was also a member of the First Council of Seventy and a stalwart of Utah’s Democratic Party. This presentation draws on my experience as the editor of his journals covering the period from 1880 to 1898. The journals tell us much about Roberts’ early life, but also illuminate his struggle with church officials over politics, his resistance to the Woodruff Manifesto, and his growth from young missionary to general authority. In short, they offer new clues into the life of one of Mormonism’s leading figures, and help us better understand his impact on the times in which he lived."

The loss of the 'Bride” in the Christian story has had tragic consequences.

Living on the threshold between two very different religious traditions, she finds herself continually negotiating those differences with extended family and friends as well as in her own marriage. She is coming to understand relationship not as socially prescribed convention but as creative ground, a space for each person to speak truth, however tentatively at first, and to become more open to the other. She will discuss the Quaker testimonies of integrity and peacemaking, which may seem to conflict but which can combine in a dance of reconciliation."

Rees, Darron Smith"	"SL04112, For thousands of years, African tribes in Mozambique and Zimbabwe have claimed Jewish heritage and priesthood lineage. Their religious practice has included monotheistic worship, circumcising male children, and dietary practices closely resembling those prescribed in the Old Testament, including eschewing the eating of pork. Although some scholars have dismissed the tribes' ancestral claims, new DNA evidence has confirmed their descent from the house of Israel, including possession of the priestly Cohanim gene. What are the implications of these findings in relation to the Church's previous denial of the priesthood to blacks? This paper examines the evidence that blacks have held or were entitled to hold the priest-hood since before the time of Christ."

Parker Blount, Christian Anderson"	"SL04113, As an LDS Church member, just how should I feel about the earth? In this session, I explore that question from the perspective of ecotheology, studies that address the extent to which Church doctrine influences members' perception and practices relative to the earth and its creatures. I suggest that LDS leaders provide limited guidance concerning our physical and spiritual relationship with our planet, and, consequently, Latter-day Saints may be neglecting the environment in ways that ultimately undermine Church goals and values. I hope to raise issues and generate discussion about ways we as Latter-day Saints might reverse this trend and become much better environmentalists."

According to Episcopal Bishop John Shelby Spong, “Mary is a male-created figure who embodies the kind of woman dominant males think is ideal, docile, obedient, powerless.” This presentation will draw parallels between the Mary described by Spong and the LDS woman idealized by today's Church leaders. According to Spong, “the feminine side of God in some new incarnation will inevitably arise.” Will Spong's prediction about Mary be proven true for Mormon women?"

Jeffrey	"SL04121, The story of Noah’s Flood has long been a matter of contention in discussions of science and religion. Though it has been discounted as baseless folklore by scientists and other scholars, recent years have seen a provocative case being made for a real event ca. 5600 Bc upon which the Noachian account may conceivably be based. This paper will briefly review the now voluminous data surrounding classical discussions of the Flood, the data involved in the new hypothesis of a massive but localized event centering on the Black Sea, and possible impacts of these new findings on traditional Mormon interpretations."

Each seems to champion the Church's well-being. But if the Church's effectiveness in serving its members and the community declines, we think, ironically, it will because of these two groups, who are united in effect if not in method. We believe the LDS Church brings perspectives into social discourse that contribute to individual and community viability. We value LDS presence in our familial, social, and political lives. We would like to share with the Sunstone audience our positive observations about this LDS presence and open a conversation that might undermine the rampant objectifying of others that seems to be accepted in Utah as a matter of course. In so doing, we hope to stimulate thinking and identify positive ways Mormon and non-Mormon might relate constructively to one of Utah's most powerful authority structures, the LDS Church."

Kay Gillespie, Quinn McKay"	"SL04123, For more than thirty-five years, Kay Gillespie has been delivering (and causing a stir) with his annual Anti-Claus lecture. His part tongue-in-cheek presentation, part in-your face lecture explores the inconsistency of celebrating the birth of Christ while at the same time presenting the antithesis to Christ in the guise of Santa Claus. Why would those interested in teaching about Christ begin their sacred relationship with their children by telling a lie that they later must unteach? Sunstone is pleased to have Gillespie present his (in)famous lecture to its audience. Come prepared to be entertained and challenged as Gillespie explores these and other issues about Santa, Christ, and parental trust."

In a rush, my twenty-five-year-old unpublished novel, written before my conversion to Mormonism, became Mormon literature. I think. What qualifies as that, exactly? Can a mystic's work join in? Can a novel written from a convert's point of view, one not culturally Mormon, find its way into the genre? Is there a place for a voice like mine? I'll share bits of my story with you.

Owens"	"SL04131, Last year, The Da Vinci Code swept other books aside in sales as well as cultural impact. The plot consumed readers while its esoteric information piqued widespread curiosity and its religious themes struck a universal nerve, the divine feminine hidden in history, art, and culture emerging from obscurity. The book asserts that Leonardo Da Vinci encoded heretical messages in his paintings, particularly the idea that Mary Magdalene and Jesus were an intimate couple. This has sparked a mass fascination with Magdalene and with secret traditions such as esoteric Christian, Gnostic, hermetic, pagan, Templar, and Grail mysteries. The result is that a legendary medieval heresy has reached a 21st-century popular audience, creating a kind of Magdalene zeitgeist. Why is this book so compelling to so many people?

Out of this collision of fervent views and disparate voices comes the decision to probe the mysterious and arcane proclivities of the Drone Democraticus, a species of semi-conscious, young Beehive State denizen who may only sporadically leave the hive and enter a booth to participate in the democratic process. “What's the buzz?, tell us what's a-happenin'.”"	SL04133	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL04133.mp3																				INTELLIGENCE AND CREATIVITY: ULTIMATES IN MORMONISM AND PROCESS THEOLOGY	"James McLachlan, Kevin Winters, Blake T. Ostler, Dan Wotherspoon, Brian Birch"	"SL04134, Alfred North Whitehead's Process and Reality is one of the classic texts of twentieth-century philosophy and laid the foundation of one of the most important movements in contemporary theology, process theology. One of Whitehead's stunning claims is that the category of the ultimate is made up of three notions. In traditional theology, one would expect only one notion, God. In process theology, the three ultimates are: the one, the many, and creativity. In this session, panelists will discuss the relevance of the process notion of creativity to LDS doctrines of intelligence and freedom. This discussion ultimately relates to how we think of the relationship between human beings and God and to the rejection of creation ex nihilo in both LDS doctrine and process theology."

Frederick (Toby) Pingree"	"SL04151, The Book of Mormon's story of Korihor, the antichrist who leads people astray by his teachings but who finally meets an unhappy end, is sometimes used as a warning to intellectuals about the dangers of dissension. But the Book of Mormon also contains stories of dissenters who were clearly good guys, prophets such as Lehi and Abinadi. What does the Book of Mormon say about the nature of dissent and how it affects the community? Does dissent strengthen or weaken the Church? How should the community respond to dissension? How can we distinguish good dissension from bad dissension? I will explore possible Book of Mormon contributions to answering these questions and interpreting the meaning of its dichotomy of good guys and bad guys."

Swedin, Jake Zollinger"	"SL04152, Latter-day Saint psychotherapists strive for the “cure of souls” through a melding of LDS theology with mainstream psychology. How and when did psychotherapeutic methodologies take hold within Mormonism, giving rise to professional organizations such as the Association of Mormon Counselors and Psychotherapists (AMCAP) and BYU's Institute for Studies in Values and Human Behavior? Author Eric Swedin will discuss the rise to acceptance of LDS psychotherapy and the places it differs from mainstream psychotherapy, especially its rejection of “selfist” elements. How have LDS doctrines of family salvation, eternalism, and understanding of the “natural man” shaped the way LDS therapists counsel clients? How does LDS psychopathology differ from that of non-LDS persons? What roles have feminist dissent and LDS philosophies of sexuality played in defining the discipline?"

In much of the world, human beings have inherited a mythology that promotes men's authority and dominance over the earth and over women. This core belief has left a legacy in which women are subjugated and our planet is being destroyed. As we enter the 21st century, we are at a critical time where we must consider a new respect for the feminine. Our planet will not survive if the belief in power and domination continues. We must embrace a mythology that pro-motes and encourages a new awareness of unity, equality, and harmony."

Chamberlin (1870â€“1921) the “foremost Mormon philosopher” and “more competent than Orson Pratt or B.H. Roberts,” but Chamberlin is largely forgotten, and his work can be found only in the special collections sections of university libraries. Chamberlin was a personalist philosopher who believed that the person was the ultimate category of reality. He studied at California and Harvard with George Holmes Howison and Josiah Royce, two of the most important American philosophers of the age. This paper focuses on Chamberlin's interpretations of Doctrine and Covenants 88, 93, and 130 to consider his idea of God as the community of persons with the Father and Mother at its head."

If David O. McKay and Emma Rae Riggs McKay were models of “eternal sweethearts” and “romance in marriage,” the Hinckley marriage, as portrayed in the media, modeled an effective partnership of somewhat overlapping but largely separate spheres. Other sources to show the social representations of desired womanhood will be addresses by members of the First Presidency to the Young Women and Relief Society in their annual broadcasts and obituaries of Mormon women printed for a four-week period shortly after Sister Hinckley's funeral"	SL04161	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL04161.mp3																				THE PEOPLING OF THE AMERICAS: LDS SCHOLARS AND THE BOOK OF MORMON	Earl M.

A growing number of LDS scholars posit that the Jaredites were just a colony in their midst some 4200 years ago, and the same for the immigrant Israelites some 1600 years later. But does the Book of Mormon let them? They think so and cite internal evidence as support. This presentation examines their evidence and the internal evidence leading to an opposite conclusion."

Smith, great-grandson of Joseph the martyr, was president of the RLDS Church from 1978 until 1996. During Smith's eighteen-year tenure, the RLDS Church trans-formed from a sect to a denomination. This shift can be seen in five innovations that occurred through his leadership. Best known is the ordination of women, which began 17 November 1985. But four other changes were part of the shift he orchestrated: construction of the temple in Independence, Missouri, during his tenure and its subsequent dedication to the pursuit of peace; the shift from closed to open communion; the appointment of a non-Smith as his successor; and finally, the idea of changing the church's name to the “Community of Christ.” What forces shaped this dynamic leader?"

Pace, Ron Frederickson"	"SL04164, “Instead of waiting for Him to return, I am going in search of the Nephite God, the Savior of the world. Jesus.” This is Zed speaking, short for “Zedekiah,” one of three Nephite apostles who Christ promised could minister to the earth's inhabitants continuously until the second coming. In this monologue, we learn that after 2,000 years, Zed, the third of the American trinity, is restless. He had been sidetracked by the theater, where, unlike his own existence, people's stories actually have endings, and feels estranged from the other two Nephites who share his charge. Recounting the history of his early life as a translator of records in ancient Zarahemla, followed by his special calling, the neurotic Zed takes us on a provocative journey from the nineteenth-century American stage to the gold mines of the Sierra Nevada, from the dusty home of a polygamous wife in Utah Territory to the horrors of the 1911 Triangle Fire in New York City. Ultimately a meditation on immortality, Zed's “voice from the dust” humorously and poignantly addresses human frailty and the contingent nature of religious texts."

But turning that vision into reality, here and now, can be frustrating. How do we make Relief Society work in the real world? How can we cultivate genuine sister-hood within our wards? How can we make visiting teaching more than a monthly obligation? How can we share others' burdens when we feel that we are barely managing to juggle our own responsibilities? Join the discussion as panelists share positive experiences, theirs and of those of others, of trying to live out the ideals of Relief Society in practical, real-world ways."

Reiss, Peggy Sherlock, Troy Williams"	"SL04172, Is television really the moral and spiritual wasteland it is often accused of being? Does network television offer more than just salacious sleaze and lowest-common-denominator humor? Are there intelligent, well-written shows with a fully functioning moral compass? Are there characters whose example, good, bad, or much more complex, inspire hope and impart transformative wisdom? Panelists in this session will speak up for television, the shows, writers, characters who have helped them see the world in a new, better, or more compassionate way. Come share your own favorites!"

Guy Bishop, Jan Shipps"	"SL04173, In a just-published volume entitled Excavating Mormon Pasts: The New Historiography of the Last Half Century, a variety of writers from both the LDS and Community of Christ traditions explore five decades of reconceptualized, revisionist, and resistant Mormon histories. The volume includes essays by such noteworthy writers as Klaus J. Hansen, Roger D. Launius, Glen M. Leonard, Davis Bitton, Martha Sonntag Bradley, and Jessie Embry. A few contributors to the volume will engage in a lively dialogue over exact definitions of the “new” Mormon history and the most significant works that define this genre. They will also offer a “progress report” of what has been done and what remains to be done."

An inflammation of the senses, it reveals itself as a subtle pleasure, or as a demand to scratch the itch. Once bitten, however, the urge is in the bloodstream. The young poets here write directly from a fresh inoculation of passion and introspection. The panel's old dog, however, who got his bite late in the chase, is still yelping, if not performing new tricks"	SL04174	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL04174.mp3																				NEPHI AND ME: PERSONAL JOURNEYS WITH THE BOOK OF MORMON	"Michael Hicks, Linda Hoffman Kimball, Trent D. Stephens, Ricardo Diaz, Kevin Barney, Van Hale, Molly M. Bennion"	"SL04191, Book of Mormon studies have broken open in recent decades, leading to many new, and widely different, theories about its historicity, origins, theology, and function. But despite this flurry of activity among scholars, apologists, and revisionists, until recent publicity over DNA studies and the Church's response caught their attention, very few Latter-day Saints had really been aware of what has been going on. Now many members are engaged in a crash course of trying to make sense of the new models and perspectives. And, understandably, some are struggling. “This isn't what I've been taught all these years!” “That doesn't seem to mesh with past prophetic utterances.” “Does this mean I'm not really a Lamanite descendent?” This is an important time in our tradition's history. Our understanding of and relationship to scripture is a crucial element in our faith journey."

This discussion focuses on the development and delivery of an “issues in Mormonism” course over a two semester period at Arizona State University. Using examples from classroom presentations, journal responses, and personal projects of the various LDS and non-LDS students in the course, we hope to illuminate some of the unique challenges of teaching Mormonism in a very large public university (especially one located in a secondary Mormon cultural region). Come find out how such a course can help both Mormons and non-Mormons develop tolerance for world-views different from their own, while also developing critical thinking skills that can serve them well inside their own religious communities."	SL04211	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL04211.mp3																				A THEOLOGY OF COLLECTIVE SIN AND GRACE	"R. Dennis Potter, Bill Hansen"	"SL04212, The traditional theologies of sin and grace, Pelagianism, Arminianism, and Calvinism, all make one assumption about the nature of sin that I believe is incorrect. They assume that sin is primarily an action carried out by an individual and for which that individual is alone responsible. I argue that individual sin is the exception and that collective sin is the norm. My arguments are based on considerations dealing with the nature of individual and collective action, moral luck, and responsibility. This theology of collective sin also yields up a communitarian notion of grace in which each participant of the community of God is equal and interdependent with the others, including God. Moreover, this theology of sin and grace roundly condemns modern manifestations of political liberalism and prescribes a society that is radically egalitarian."

Koyle claimed he had been visited by a heavenly being who told him there was a vast deposit of Nephite gold in a hill in Salem, Utah. The messenger said the gold in this hill was to provide relief to the Church and the U.S. government after a severe economic collapse. As Koyle's revelatory experiences and flair for prophecy became more dramatic, LDS authorities pressured Koyle and his followers to abandon the Relief Mine, as it was known. In 1913, at the Church's request, noted geologist/ Apostle James E. Talmage investigated the Relief Mine, ultimately declaring that no gold would ever be found there. For years, a battle ensued between supporters of Talmage and Koyle regarding the mine's efficacy. The 1913 First Presidency statement “A Warning Voice” was an outgrowth of this controversy, the document comprising a quasi-scriptural refutation of mining ventures and revelations coming from other than authorized sources. This paper will examine the history behind the conflict, accounts of Bishop Koyles' various prophecies, and some lesser-known writings from Talmage's journals."

"Anne Castleton,"	"SL04214, Many of us are aware of the HIV/AIDS crisis but don't know how we, as individuals or as a church community, might helpfully respond. I will address those questions as well as the scope of the epidemic, why it is now considered a national security issue, and how this disease's connection with sexuality affects the way the world has responded to the crisis. I will examine what resources exist within Christian and LDS theology to help us over-come our hesitations in becoming more involved in stopping this potential genocide."

Persephone Awakened is a book of poems written in a contemporary voice of Persephone as she addresses a childhood companion whom she loses after her abduction. The poems are accompanied by Japanese Shakuhachi flute music (the silent voice of the male companion); the entire piece creates a balance of female and male “voices.”"	SL04215	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL04215.mp3																				PROPHETS AND PROPHECY IN THE MORMON TRADITION	"Jan Shipps, Ron Romig, J. Bonner Ritchie"	"SL04221, A work in progress, an exploration of the place of prophets and the function of prophecy in Mormonism, this paper will point both to differences across time—in early versus recent years—and to variations in the role of prophets and the function of prophecy in alternative forms of Mormonism."

It was an interesting attempt to encompass the entire gospel plan, from pre-mortality to the afterlife. After that came a long dry period for LDS novels, with the form resurfacing in the 1940s and â€˜50s. But novels were few and far between until the â€˜70s, when Mormon love stories began to grow in popularity. Now Mormons are featured in hundreds of novels published by regional and national houses. Are our religion and culture accurately reflected in this burgeoning literary form?"

Quite early, she learned to answer yes and no to questions by lifting or lowering her head slightly. In grade school, by means of a computer with software operated by a few facial muscles, she learned to write in short sentences. Thanks to that technology, Natasha's alert, vibrant, and affectionate personality has emerged. She has been baptized and endowed. The presenter, a close relative, will show a brief video of Natasha, narrate her history, and read Natasha's answers to questions about religion in her life."

Jess Groesbeck, Bruce Jorgensen"	"SL04224, I will continue developing the thesis that the Book of Mormon is not literal, but symbolic, archetypal history brought forth by the visionary Joseph Smith, in shamanic fashion, as a grand symbolic, spiritual ethic to rebalance the culture into which it came. Calling on the work of Carl Jung and John Weir Perry, I will demonstrate how the Book of Mormon matches almost perfectly a ten-stage archetypal sequence uncovered through careful study of persons undergoing psychic stress but working their way toward resolution. Can this progression so integral to individual healing helpfully illuminate why the Book of Mormon has so successfully spoken to mil-lions of people all over the world?"

Ostler"	"SL04225, For the past several years, I've noticed a trend among theologians and philosophers of religion away from the first-person and autobiography-driven work that is part and parcel of the postmodern shift and toward a more conscious placing of their arguments once again in a logical framework. I think this is an important step if philosophers are to reach the coming generation who, as a whole, are quite comfortable with math- and logic-driven thinking. As a non-LDS theologian who has an interest in Mormon thought, I've noticed that most Mormons have been reluctant to make this shift away from the autobiographical. Imagine my pleasant surprise in discovering the writings of Blake T. Ostler. In this session, I will explore Ostler's argumentation and how I believe it bodes well for future Mormon contributions to philosophy and theology."

Kimball, Mary Ann Morgan"	"SL04231, As part of its mission to host respectful discussions of all perspectives and topics related to Mormonism, Sunstone occasionally invites participants who have left Mormonism to speak and share their stories. This session features the stories of those who have chosen the opposite tack, highlighting the struggles of those who have chosen to remain active, dedicated Latter-day Saints even in the face of many difficult issues that challenge traditional faith. How have some wrestled with their faith and yet still emerged more determined than ever to be a part of the Latter-day Saint community?"

Parker Blount, Jana Reiss, John Dewey Remy"	"SL04232, Unlike Christianity, many religions downplay belief and instead emphasize behavior, so that what one believes is of little consequence compared to what one does. As Karen Armstrong stresses, religions such as Judaism and Buddhism are not about accepting a body of doctrine but ""about doing things that change you. It's a moral aesthetic, an ethical alchemy. if you behave a certain way, you will be transformed."" Viewed from this perspective, and leaving aside any question of testimony and faith, what are the special benefits offered by cultivating religious habits and behaviors either unique to Mormonism or approached in a uniquely Mormon manner? How do the practices of Mormonism help us achieve that ""moral aesthetic, that ethical alchemy"" that transforms us into beings more closely allied with the divine?"

Stevens, Jason Gallentine, Scot Denhalter, Michael Ash, Kristine Haglund Harris"	"SL04233, The Internet has exposed many Latter-day Saints to anti-Mormon arguments and claims for the very first time. Consequently, LDS apologists have brought their defenses online in order to counteract or minimize the critics' influence. Yet in the process of neutralizing such “attacks,” have the apologists inadvertently redefined the role and relevance of the prophets and, by extension, Mormonism itself? Does “Mormonism” as defined by the apologists and imbibed by faithful Web-surfing Mormons correspond to “Mormonism” as defined by the average member in the pews? What are the main points where “Internet Mormons” differ from “Chapel Mormons”? How are these differences playing out in LDS chapels, seminaries, and institutes today? How might things change even more as greater numbers of Latter-day Saints become aware of the criticisms and defenses (which often involve shifts in basic understandings or approaches to questions)?"

Yet they are limited to only one perspective and are hardly the final word on a subject's life. How can diaries help shine light in dark places, helping to illuminate the past? What are their limitations? What deciphering do they require? panelists will relate their experiences sharing the lives of diary keepers."

Ten years after the play was first staged, a six-hour, 60 million HBO production with Al Pacino, Meryl Streep, and Emma Thompson was aired on cable (soon to be available on DVD). In this session, panelists who have written about either the stage version or the HBO production will revisit this drama rich in Mormon themes and characters. How does the HBO production compare to the original script? How are Mormons and Mormonism represented? Does Angels in America have something important to say to our time?"

"Paul Swenson, Marv Hamilton, Leanna Rae Scott, Manny Garcia, John Hatch"	"SL04241, Part documentary, part mockumentary, part passionate political witness, part uproarious entertainment, this surprisingly commercially successful film criticizing the Bush administration's response to the World Trade Center attack; the president's launch and conduct of the Iraq war; the Patriot Act, and the Abu Ghraib torture scandal has provoked national debate. Meanwhile, two Mormons, Bush administration lawyer (now federal judge) Jay Bybee, and Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch have fanned the flames. Bybee wrote the memo used to justify prison torture, and Hatch observed interrogation tactics at Guantanamo, Cuba and pronounced them proper."

More accurately, however, the Manifesto introduced another set of problems that came to a head in 1903 with the nationwide protest over the election of LDS apostle Reed Smoot to the U.S. Senate and the resulting Senate interrogation of LDS Church leaders, including President Joseph F. Smith. Latter-day Saints, their Protestant protestors, and the Senate had conflicting interests at stake in the four-year political trial. This session will focus on the means by which these conflicts were resolved and the definitive effect the resolution has had on twentieth century Mormonism."

I argue for an open-ended approach to LDS scripture that recognizes a substantial “cause to believe” in support of faith and also recognizes what Kuhn calls the “essential tension” necessary for working on unresolved problems. What are the means by which the same information can be valued as a “counterinstance,” a “puzzle,” or as “cause to believe?” I believe Ian Barbour's concept of critical realism can help us find our way through these difficult but fascinating issues."

AN EXPLORATION ON MANAGING GRIEF AND LOSS	Mary Ellen Robertson	"SL04253, Ever had difficulty handling grief or a loss, either yours or someone else's? Ever wonder what to say or how you might help? In this interactive, workshop-style session, I will draw from my own experiences with grief and the insights I found valuable in The Grief Recovery Handbook. In this session, we will use communication exercises to explore our own ideas regarding grief and introduce some new ways of thinking about grief and loss."

This presentation explores issues elicited by teaching about Mormonism as part of a course entitled “Modern Religious Movements” at a Roman Catholic liberal arts college. The predominately Catholic students brought a variety of perceptions of the LDS Church to the class, ranging from “cult” to full acceptance as part of the Christian tradition. Through an engagement with LDS primary sources and Douglas Davies's Introduction to Mormonism, as the course developed, the students developed a more nuanced understanding of the similarities and differences between the LDS and Catholic traditions, an understanding that framed the students' critique of John Krakauer's treatment of Latter-day Saints in his Under the Banner of Heaven"	SL04254	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL04254.mp3																				A FIGURE IN THE TAPESTRY: THE POET'S FEELING RUNS AHEAD OF HER IMAGINATION (GREENWICH VILLAGE 1949â€“50)	"Paul Swenson, Laraine Wilkens"	"SL04255, May Swenson, Utah-born poet of Swedish Mormon immigrant parents, whom critic John Hollander calls “one of our few unquestionably major poets,” was within a few days of her thirty-sixth birthday when she met Pearl Schwartz. A woman of Mediterranean descent just past twenty-six, Schwartz was an attendant at a contagious disease hospital. Swenson would soon cross the threshold of a fertile creative crescent in which many of her most evocative love poems would emerge, as well as a broad variety of other work that would appear in her first book, Another Animal in 1954. Later, the two would travel by Greyhound to Utah, where Pearl met May's Mormon family. (An earlier version of this paper was presented at the first annual May Swenson Symposium at Utah State University this past June.)"

Michael Quinn, Elbert Eugene Peck"	"SL04261, Twenty years ago, Michael Quinn demonstrated that plural marriage had been actively practiced within the Church after the 1890 Manifesto. Kathleen Flake's recent book tries to explain why that was and what finally motivated the Church to abandon the practice between 1905 and 1910 in the context of the seating of Apostle Reed Smoot in the U.S. Senate. This session will explore ways of understanding these pivotal, turbulent, and dramatic changes, and why it matters."

However, it was as a private citizen that Romney most exemplified the philosophy that voluntarism is not an act of charity but an act of citizenship. Romney believed that we each have a moral responsibility to be involved in organized volunteer activities to improve the well-being of the community, the nation, and the world. His efforts in founding many of the organizations that today facilitate the link between volunteers and those in need is legendary. Romney is credited as the driving force and inspiration for the 1997 Presidents' Summit for America's Future, which brought together all past U.S. presidents (held following Romney's death in 1995). This session will discuss Romney's philosophy and work in this important dimension of civil society."

A number of questions have been raised. Was Solomon Spalding the author, or Sidney Rigdon, or Joseph Smith, or was it the work of multiple authors? The authors of one article assert that the statistical odds that Joseph Smith, Spalding, or Rigdon wrote the Book of Mormon are less than one in one hundred billion. However, a string of significant uncertainties exists regarding every point germane to wordprint analyses in general that undermine the very merit of Book of Mormon wordprint studies. Is it likely that an ancient author's “wordprint” could survive the original Hebrew abridgment, then translation into an unknown hieroglyphic, and then translation by a yet unsettled process (word-for-word, thought-for-thought, or some other?) into a particular nineteenth-century, grammatically flawed, American English? Did Joseph Smith play a role in word choices, or was he simply a reader? Is the range of Joseph Smith's wordprint so narrow as to exclude him as the author of or contributor to the wording of the Book of Mormon? This paper will consider these questions and more."

MORMON FICTION IN THE 21ST CENTURY	"Todd Robert Petersen, Eric Samuelsen"	"SL04264, There is an elephant in the room whenever one ventures to discuss the state of LDS writing, namely: do LDS people actually read LDS literature? Or more to the point, do they buy it? In this presentation, I explore the notion that LDS writers may have to reach beyond the LDS audience in order to grab them. Curiously, LDS filmmakers seem to be crossing over better than do the fiction writers. Analyzing the filmmakers' work can give fiction writers insights on how to write Mormon fiction that non-Mormons can stomach, which might just get Mormon writers back onto Mormon bookshelves."

Ryan Cragun	"SL04265, The way something is classified carries significant consequences for how it's perceived. Such is the case with the rise of Mormon intellectualism and the desire among some to have it be seen as a “community” rather than a “movement.” In this presentation, I argue that debates over such things are now pointless: those who would/do oppose intellectualism's influence on Mormonism already consider it a movement and have taken measures to reduce its influence. Using a model based on studies of political processes and social movements, I highlight similarities between Mormon intellectualism and other social movements. In so doing, I intend to describe more than prescribe, but those interested in transforming Mormon intellectualism in such a way that it might take less heat will likely find profitable ideas swirling throughout the presentation."

Toscano"	"SL04271, This panel invites Mormon women to talk about how they find meaning and inspiration in images of divine female power drawn from other religions and traditions. What do we learn about ourselves as women and as agents of the divine by studying the stories or representations of goddesses such as Shakti, Kali, Rhiannon, Venus, Athena, Spider Woman, White Buffalo Woman, Isis, Kuan Yin, and so forth? Especially when contrasted to Mother in Heaven, who, unlike Father in Heaven, cannot be discussed, named, or depicted (and so remains little more than an abstraction), how do these figures and the aspects of the divine they embody offer us challenges, comfort, and confirmation?"

That imaginary position is the starting point for this session, in which panelists will give very brief overviews of what they believe is the best idea in Mormonism; the idea or practice that is uniquely Mormon or which Mormonism emphasizes differently than do other religious traditions; the idea they find the most interesting, clarifying, empowering, or inspiring, and one they hope will never be abandoned as Mormonism continues to evolve.

Each will discuss his mission experience, his reaction to tough doctrinal and historical issues, and his reasons for his particular path since returning home.

VOICES IN EXILE: STORIES OF LESBIAN MORMONS	"Dylan McDonald, Susan Randall, Mary Jones, ""Annalee Watkins"""	"SL04275, The 49-minute documentary, Voices in Exile, introduces viewers to eight lesbian Mormons as they tell about their experiences in the faith. These women know the LDS culture and have lived the life, they can sing the songs from Primary, they served missions, they held Church callings, they married in the temple, and they raised children. And, all too often, they have felt the need to reject their rich pasts. The interviews broach issues of pain, guilt, depression, suicide, acceptance, and hope, providing a fascinating look into a segment of the faith forced into exile. Filmed entirely in Idaho over several years, the film was funded by Boise State University."

Russell	"SL04312, LDS members do not have to vote on whether a purported statement by their prophet is a revelation or not. But since 1878, RLDS delegates to General Conferences (now “World Conferences”) have carried the obligation of debating and voting whether a document presented to the conference by the prophet is a revelation and should be added to the Doctrine and Covenants. In periods of severe controversy within the church, such as during the 1920s “Supreme Directional Control” debates and the 1980s controversy over women's ordination, a significant minority of delegates have voted against the pro-posed revelation. The recent 2004 conference had some delegates reacting negatively to a revelation (now Section 162), from the first non-Smith president/prophet, which they thought was subtly supporting the acceptance of the ministry of homosexuals. This paper will explore the difficult challenge facing RLDS delegates as they attempt to decide if a document should become part of our canon of scripture."

HUNTER: BRIEF PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATIONS, PROFOUND PROPHETIC UTTERANCE"	"Richard N. Armstrong, Becky Johns"	"SL04313, Although Harold B. Lee served as Church president for fewer than eighteen months and Howard W. Hunter, for only nine months, through their general conference addresses, both men had a profound effect on the membership. I will analyze the content of their presidential messages, along with their speaking styles, in an effort to explain their great success as Church presidents, brief as their tenures were."

"Shawn Aaron McCraney, Kim McCall"	"SL04314, Complications from recent developments in Book of Mormon studies and new views of Joseph Smith have placed the LDS Church in a familiar position. Not one familiar to it, per se, but one that strongly parallels the developmental paths of Seventh-day Adventism, the Worldwide Church of God, and the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (now Community of Christ). When faced with difficulties presented by new historical interpretations and alarmed by growing malaise among their memberships, Church leaders in each case chose to deemphasize many of their distinctive and problematic teachings, uniting with and being revitalized by the wider Christian movement. Should the LDS Church seriously consider following suit?"	SL04314	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL04314.mp3																				SATANIC SYMBOL ON THE NAUVOO TEMPLE?	"Alex Caldiero, Allen Roberts"	"SL04315, This illustrated lecture takes as its subject a superficially documented and misunderstood feature of Mormon iconography, the pentagram. This symbol, as it appears on Mormon temples, takes two forms: one pointing up, and one down. The latter type is referred to as the star of Mendes and is often simplistically interpreted by detractors to have a satanic meaning in connection with Mormonism. In this session, I will: (1) outline Pythagorean and Platonic symbologies as they relate to the pentagram and other relevant imagery; (2) illustrate and interpret the use of this symbol on Mormon temples, specifically the Salt Lake temple and the recently rebuilt temple at Nauvoo; and (3) relate the pentagram and associated symbols to the Mormon doctrines of redemption and salvation."

WOOLLEY: ARCHANGELS BETWEEN NINETEENTH-CENTURY POLYGAMY AND TWENTIETH-CENTURY MORMON FUNDAMENTALISM	Marianne T. Watson	"SL04316, A large majority of today's Fundamentalist Mormons believe authority to perform plural marriages outside the Church originated in1886 when LDS Church President John Taylor received a revelation regarding plural marriage as well as a personal visitation from Joseph Smith and Jesus Christ. They believe President Taylor ordained a few trusted men with apostolic authority and appointed them to perpetuate “the principle” whether “in” or “out” of the Church. By 1916, John W. and his son Lorin C. Woolley were the only ones still living of the men reportedly ordained and appointed by President Taylor. This paper presents an overview of experiences, based on first-hand diary accounts, of three men who believed John W. and Lorin C. Woolley's claims that legitimate priesthood authority still existed to perform plural marriages."

Jay helped start a collection of gay Mormon materials at the archives of the University of Utah and created a GLBT Studies CD-ROM that he shared with friends and fellow researchers. In this session we will celebrate Jay's life and his important contributions to LDS research. Attendees will be invited to share some of their own reminiscences as time allows."

Mauss"	"SL04321, Recent years have seen the rise of a Mormon intellectual movement I call “progressive orthodoxy.” Exemplified most prominently by the limited geography model for the Book of Mormon, progressive orthodoxy seeks to affirm LDS faith claims in ways that are credible by scholarly standards. Progressive orthodox scholars thus seek to balance two opposing forces that shape religious movements: assimilation and separation. How does that balancing effort compare with analogous efforts by scholars in other American religious groups, especially evangelical Christians? And how does the rise of progressive orthodoxy complicate the model for Mormon assimilation put forth by Armand Mauss in his classic study The Angel and the Beehive?"

Each autobiography illustrates the strained position of many Mormon women as they alternately worked to achieve the Victorian-Mormon ideal of women's chastity while also shaping themselves to become the object of men's desire and, at times, the survivors of men's sexual exploitation."

Jeff Burton	"SL04323, Mormons have historically been expected to gain a “testimony” of the unique religious tenets of the Church. This expectation has been so prevalent that those not able to testify to having such “knowledge” typically feel marginalized, unworthy, and suspect in the eyes of believers. One peculiar response to this expectation has been the (unwitting) creation of a group of Mormons whom, twenty-plus years ago in Sunstone, I labeled “closet doubters”, active Church members who either pretend to “know,” or who remain silent and secretive about their not knowing. In this session, I will share my observations about how the environment for closet doubters has changed during the past two decades. Are the “testimony” expectations still as strong? How have they changed? Are there as many closet doubters now as there were then? Are conditions in the Church better now for their “coming out” to family, friends, and leaders? I invite a vigorous discussion and sharing of experiences!"

Ten years later, David Sedaris dissected his eclectic North Carolina childhood in his highly irreverent Me Talk Pretty One Day. Schizophrenically inspired by both authors, this essay is a series of humorous and reflective vignettes from an occasionally delinquent and often misspent youth in Cleveland, and ruminations on the interplay of nature, nurture, and Nephi in my pretty Mormon childhood."

Smith spends a lot of time in classrooms directly confronting the notion that blacks were and still are under a divine curse. His paper uses anecdotes about con-fronting religiously-based racist ideas, and explores, in particular, the resistance of LDS students to counter-hegemonic discourses."

Wayne Schow, Brian Stuy"	"SL04326, In our quest for religious knowledge, we are enmeshed in particular, limiting environments that unavoidably impinge on our perception of what is real and true. Thus language, history, and culture are the filters through which our understanding will be screened; they pro-vide the acquired perceptual frameworks through which we organize our spiritual experience. Much of humankind's effort to establish religious truth seems not only to ignore but also actually to deny our existential limitations. Therefore, some examination of these matters, including the epistemology of Holy Writ, seems justified."

The panelists represent a wide range of research, professional activity, and personal experience with persons with disabilities. Panelists will consider the following questions: Given that persons with disabilities and their caretakers are often sensitive, what is an appropriate terminology for such a discussion? What difference is there in the problems facing the physically disabled and the mentally impaired? What are the theological implications of persons with disabilities? The moral implications? What programs and social services for persons with disabilities does the Church provide? What generalizations may be made about the attitude of Mormon folk toward persons with disabilities? What is being done to improve the lot of Latter-day Saints with disabilities? What more can be done?"

Rex Spears, Grant Palmer, Brian Birch"	"SL04333, Abstract Mormonism seems to be in the midst of an identity crisis. For Church members, its founding claim to be the restoration of primitive Christianity along with its theology and worship practices have always made it feel very Christian. But with the Church's efforts to emphasize Mormonism's message of Christ even more strongly, subtitling the Book of Mormon, changing the Church logo, becoming more involved in coalitions with other traditions, supporting interreligious dialogue that emphasizes Mormon similarities with traditional Christianity rather than its differences, is Mormonism on a path toward becoming too “Christian,” too generic, just one more Christian flavor among many? While many applaud the new emphases, others are feeling as if too much is being lost, too many traditional LDS doctrines are being deemphasized and perhaps on their way to being abandoned altogether. Panelists' perspectives in this session differ widely on the Church's uncertain identity. How “Christian” should Mormonism be? It's an important discussion. Please join in!"

The film dramatizes the true story of a small band of soldiers, survivors of the Malmedy Massacre during the Battle of the Bulge, fighting their way through the harsh Belgium winter in the Ardennes forest. The soldiers work tirelessly to smuggle essential intelligence to the Allies, all the while forced to evade German troops.

During an evening meeting, several women spoke about plural marriage, underscoring their experiences on the following topics: (1) polygamy does not equal abuse; (2) polygamy does not equal fraud; (3) polygamy does not equal ignorance; (4) polygamy does equal support; (5) polygamy does equal opportunity; and (6) polygamy is a Constitutionally-protected freedom. This excellent presentation was very well received by the government officials, opening the door for subsequent communication and greater understanding.

The data shows that very few have been able to use therapy successfully as a method for change. This report includes findings from a past president of the Association of Mormon Counselors and Psychotherapists (AMCAP) and other key LDS therapists. Panelists will also discuss a report from a past leader in Evergreen International (an organization dedicated to helping Latter-day Saints overcome same-sex attraction), data on clients that were followed for a four-year period as part of a doctoral dissertation, and other reports from members of the panel including an LDS bishop who has ministered to about fifty such persons."

Blessed with piercing intelligence, a wry sense of humor, and a radar always tuned to finding life's wonderful ironies, Clifton has never been afraid to share what's on his mind. In this session, he will share his “Mormon story,” reflecting on spiritual touchstones, the people and ideas he loves, and the events and forces which led him toward his eventual conversion to Judaism.

David Anderson	"SL04352, In 1992, John Sorenson published his article “When Lehi's Party Arrived in the Land, Did They Find Others There?” Sorenson urges that they did, and that the Book of Mormon should be read as containing references to these “others” who had to have been present, but are not expressly mentioned. Indeed, Sorenson's “Others” hypothesis is now understood as a principal feature of the “Limited Tehuantepec Model” of the Book of Mormon. Under that model, the existence of these Necessary, Inferred Mayans (NIMs), is essential to the book's historicity because the early narrative events in the Land of Promise could not have occurred without them. So why are they so invisible, and voiceless? This paper critically assesses the “Others” hypothesis and identifies certain consequences it has for the Book of Mormon story."

Compton, John Hatch"	"SL04353, When, as counselor in the First Presidency, Hugh B. Brown stated that he was a Democrat because Democrats were more sensitive to the poor, he put his finger on an aspect of the gospel that many Mormons separate from their view of religion. Yet many scriptures show that compassion for the poor is central to the gospel. I contend that attitudes of Republicans and Democrats toward rich and poor help illuminate their attitudes toward many issues, such as civil rights, education, campaign finance reform, health insurance, foreign policy, the military, and the environment. It would behoove us to be sensitive to the poor as we vote in next November's elections."

Parshall	"SL04354, The Supreme Court's 1879 ruling on the constitutionality of anti-polygamy laws triggered an offensive in the campaign to crush Mormonism. Within days of the Court's ruling, the Secretary of State notified U.S. ambassadors to seek the help of foreign governments to “check the organization of [this] criminal enterprise” by halting the work of missionaries and cutting off the supply of “recruits” emigrating to Utah “with the intent of violating [U.S.] laws and committing crimes.” While sympathetic, newspapers and governments generally labeled the Secretary's request as impractical, and the matter faded from public discussion. Unnoticed by either the press or the Church, however, the Secretary's request remained the official policy of the U.S. government throughout the 1880s. Friendly nations were prodded to follow its guidelines, and less friendly nations could carry out repressive measures knowing there would be no U.S. government interference on behalf of its Mormon citizens abroad. This paper uses state department files, newspaper accounts, and LDS mission records to examine the U.S. government's methods in pursuing the eradication of polygamy within its borders."

These characterizations have been made by embittered former members, politicians, muckraking journalists, and a writer of wilderness and mountain-climbing books. The only people with access to the community who have come to their defense have been their Salt Lake City attorneys. Since the January 2004 excommunication of Colorado City Mayor Dan Barlow and others in what appears to be a power struggle, no one inside the community has effectively presented his or her viewpoint. I am quite familiar with these communities, considering myself sympathetic with but not uncritical of their situation and recent events.

Michael Quinn	"SL04361, Patterns of religious doubt, disbelief, and disaffiliation can be as diverse and interesting as patterns of religious inquiry, faith, and conversion. Both patterns can be temporary, decades-long, or lifelong. Both involve the mind, the spirit, and the emotions. Drawing on decades of research in Mormon/LDS/RLDS documents, this paper discusses patterns of doubt and resolution involving devout believers in the Restoration claims and teachings of Joseph Smith Jr. and his successors (as variously defined). The paper then compares those findings with scholarly studies of pat-terns of doubt and resolution among Christians generally.

This discussion will explore why some LDS women have chosen Wiccan and similar practices as either supplements to or replacements for their Mormonism. How and where were these women exposed to these new beliefs and practices? How do they characterize their new identity? What impact have these spiritual-religious changes had on their families? How do those who have chosen to remain LDS view their relationship to the Church and church activity? Do they see their practices as acts of apostasy?"

John Williams, Brent Metcalfe"	"SL04363, Recent comparative attempts to characterize the DNA challenge to Book of Mormon historicity as a “Galileo Event” are interesting and provocative, but they have led to turf wars over who, exactly, is the “Galileo” figure and whether the revolutionary “events” in sixteenth-century astronomy and Catholic doctrine are an appropriate model for under-standing the debate on Book of Mormon historicity. In this paper, I argue that the global imaginaries, geographies, and mythologies of Christopher Columbus's “discovery” of the New World offer a more compelling model for our attempts to articulate the current debate on Book of Mormon historicity, in short, a “Colon-ializing Event.”"	SL04363	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL04363.mp3																				"PACIFISM, PRIESTHOOD, AND POWER"	"Dennis Clark, Michael J. Stevens"	"SL04364, In this paper, I examine closely two events in service of creating a strong foundation for Mormon pacifism: (1) Joseph Smith's writing of a letter from Liberty Jail, in which the Lord rebukes him for praying for vengeance on the Missourians; and (2) Smith's assassination, toward which he went more like a lion than a lamb to the slaughter. I believe that when seen in context, these diverse texts provide important resources for understanding exactly what it means to be a peacemaker."

This “other” struggle is about meaning making. Men, women, and adolescents exert enormous amounts of mental, emotional, and spiritual energy in an effort to find, create, or craft a story to help them make sense of their journey. It is a hero's journey insomuch as one must leave the safety of an offered identity, given by others, in favor of an identity forged by self.

What makes the book so popular? The desire for the divine feminine? The possibility of Jesus being married? The connection between Mary Magdalene and the holy grail? The American citizenry's penchant for conspiracy theories? The hope of uncovering new knowledge about Christianity's origins?

He attempts to bring into focus several familiar, if murky issues, folk magic, treasure-digging, anti-masonry, and pious fraud, painting a detailed portrait of Joseph Smith as a sincere evangelical who used dubious means to promote faith. Of particular interest is Vogel's close reading of the Book of Mormon as reflecting Smith's biography and concerns.

In addition, 50,000 children from faithful families are malnourished, and one can point to 5300 annual cases of severe preventable disability among faithful members (mostly children) and 900 annual deaths (85 percent of whom are children) in this same group which could have been pre-vented at very little cost. This panel will discuss the health/nutrition status of LDS children in LDCs and the long-term effects of childhood malnutrition, the pragmatic and philosophical rationale for the present situation, and the potential for meaningful, cost-effective intervention from a Church and non-Church standpoint."

Jeff Burton, Dan Wotherspoon, Kenny Kemp"	"SL04374, The model of faith development presented by James W. Fowler in his classic study, The Stages of Faith: The Psychology of Human Development and the Quest for Meaning, has helped many people from a wide variety of religious traditions better understand their own faith journey. It has been embraced especially by many who feel they have “lost” their faith or recognize that they are in some way transitioning into new ways of under-standing God and the universe or are struggling with changing relationships with their tradition's sacred texts, teachings, and broader religious community. Panelists familiar with the work of Fowler and other stage theorists will discuss Mormon-specific applications of this approach to understanding faith, including the pros and cons of stage theory in general. In what ways is it helpful? Where does it fall short?

Earlier today (session 351), Clifton shared his “Mormon story,” in which he reflected on the foundational experiences and spiritual touchstones of his LDS youth and early adult-hood, on his family and the many Mormon friends who are still so dear, as well as on the events and longings which led to his new life, to his new marriage to Gail and his multi-faceted engagement with Judaism. In this session, Clifton will take us into his new home, into his deep longings for community, for soulful connection with others. He wonders, as do his wife, in-laws, and members of his synagogue, “Can a Mormon become a Jew?” It's a question he and they are still answering day by day, and if you know anything about Clifton, you know it's a matter that has his full attention, something to which he's applying all of his gifts. Embracing the best of his two spiritual homes, he's “becoming Jew-ish” while remaining delightful, insightful. He's a whirl-wind, and, as it was for ancient Israel, God's voice echoes throughout his gusty journey."

WHITE, AND MARY BAKER EDDY: FOUR AMERICAN PROPHETS' PERSPECTIVES ON SLAVERY, RACE, AND ETHNICITY"	"Newell Bringhurst, Lavina Fielding Anderson"	"SF05011, This presentation compares and contrasts Joseph Smith's views and practices regarding slavery, race, and ethnicity with those of William Miller and Ellen G. White (founding leaders of Seventh Day Adventism) and Mary Baker Eddy (founder of the Christian Science movement). These issues figured prominently in all three religious movements, but while all four leaders were New England born, except for a brief embrace, Smith differed from the others by rejecting the region's dominant attitudes on race issues, which were generally abolitionist and relatively progressive. What circumstances and forces led Smith to reject these “enlightened alternatives”?"

The first essay explores the context of the project. Why should we engage in such speculation as this? What is the LDS view of the role of reason in religious and spiritual life? How do we view the various attempts by others, including church leaders and prophets through the ages, to communicate this central message? The second essay focuses on the “concept” of the atonement. What is it that an explanation of the atonement is trying to explain? Before we try to understand just what Jesus did or how he did it, we need some conceptual clarity about the task he was undertaking, the problem he was solving."

Campbell"	"SF05013, LDS writers addressing the challenges of modern science, ranging from evolution and cosmology to Book of Mormon historicity, have frequently resorted to arguments derived from either the creationist or the postmodern science studies communities. The literature of these two groups, while poles apart on most intellectual and social issues, exhibits characteristics of poor scholarship, including a preference for ideologically correct conclusions over sound evidence and reasoning, significant misunderstandings of mathematical and scientific principles, a reluctance to subject scholarship to rigorous outside review, and usage of gratuitous and often meaningless scientific jargon. In short, the creationist and postmodern science studies communities are hardly recommended as allies to LDS scholarship. The challenges to the Church from modern science must be  addressed head-on."

Andrew Shelton	"SF05014, In May 2002, the First Presidency of the Community of Christ appointed a twelve-member task force to give attention to the significant theological issues facing the church. The task force's first statement, “Scripture in the Community of Christ” was published in June 2003. It dealt generally with the issue of the use of scripture in the church without addressing the group's specific concerns regarding the denomination's continued use of the Inspired Version, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants. In the nearly two years that followed, the task force struggled to compose a statement on these issues, and in March 2005, the group agreed that it had reached an impasse and decided to move on to the task of formulating a denominational Christology. In this presentation, task force member Andrew Shelton will speak about the conclusions the task force has reached regarding Restoration scripture, and preview the group's coming work on Christology, which he hopes will eventually help the denomination better address the issue of scripture."

This concise 190-page document, organized alphabetically from A (Aaronic Priesthood) to Z (Zion) thus joins the missionary “white book” of behavioral rules, the newest revision of For the Strength of Youth (explanations of principles governing correct behavior), Bruce R. McConkie's Mormon Doctrine (very authoritarian but not “authorized”), and the procedures and policies in the Church Handbook of Instructions (not generally available to members). Although aimed specifically at “youth, young single adults, and new converts,” it for the first time makes available a source upon which members can draw with complete reliance that “this is what we believe.” This paper samples some entries from this under-advertised but significant work in the context of other behavioral handbooks now available. -- & -- The Proclamation on the Family is now 10 years old. It has been widely promulgated and heavily promoted in official church literature. Decorative copies adorn church building walls and the walls of devout Mormon family homes. This paper explores how the Family Proclamation is used in official Mormon discourse and how it is viewed by faithful Mormons. It also takes a brief look at official Mormon proclamations of the past and asks whether the Family Proclamation has a future as a permanent feature of Mormon belief."

"Robert Wrathall, Todd Compton"	"SF05032, JOSEPH SMITH AND THE GNOSTIC RESTORATION - & - MY “POSSIBLE” CATEGORY: JOSEPH SMITH'S LESSER-KNOW WIVES? The discovery of the Nag Hammadi third-century Gnostic Library has awakened interest in this very early form of Christianity. My proposal is that if Joseph Smith restored true Christianity, then it should share many similarities with Gnosticism. Indeed, there are many strong parallels between these two theologies, starting with a shared sense that humans are saved by intimate knowledge of God and that the eternal unity of the sexes is necessary for “exaltation.” Further, this historical record shows us that churches run by the spirit will be brought under control by hierarchy. - - - - - - - - - - - - - When I was writing In Sacred Loneliness: The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith, I had to decide which women could be safely documented as authentic wives of Joseph Smith. I eventually came up with a list of 33 women, but I added another list of “possible wives” (8 women) and another of “early posthumous marriages” (8 more women). So Joseph Smith, Jr. could have very easily married 40-50 women, rather than the conservative 33 I discuss in depth in my book. In this paper, I examine the evidence for Joseph Smith's marrying the eight “possible wives,” and give a brief overview of their lives."

Bailey"	"SF05033, Over the past several decades, members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as well as the Church itself have struggled with the complex dimensions of homosexuality. The evolving dialogue about the religious, moral, political, and social issues surrounding homosexuality has included many voices. In Quiet Desperation adds to the dialogue the voices of a parent of a gay Latter-day Saint who committed suicide and a young Latter-day Saint man who has chosen to live a life of faithful celibacy. As with others who have contributed to the dialogue about what it means to be homosexual in the Mormon Church and what the responsibility of heterosexuals is toward their gay and lesbian brothers and sisters, the authors of this book give us much to think about. The panel will examine the ideas put forth by the authors in the hope of expanding our understanding of this issue."

Yet Emma Smith was charged with compiling “a selection of sacred hymns . . . which is pleasing unto me, to be had in my church” (D&C 25:11). Eighteenth- and nineteenth- century musical forms and lyrics were dirge-like, focusing on man's evil nature and relief through death. This presentation traces Emma's legacy in creating a new, distinctive genre of sacred music that continues to dominate the LDS hymn tradition. Following this presentation, join in as we do a little “shape note singing,” an exuberant style of community singing and the original form in which many of our favorite hymns were sung."

This presentation examines in summary the Mormon raid and cleansing of non-Mormons from Daviess County, Missouri, and will examine in detail Crooked River, where the Mormon troops routed the state troops camped next to the small stream in Ray County, Missouri. The combination of these two attacks resulted in the expulsion of the Mormons from the state of Missouri."

Particularly suggestive is our ability, notably publicized by Cambridge geneticist Bryan Sykes's Seven Daughters of Eve, to track mitochondrial DNA mutations to seven European “clan mothers”, and beyond them, to African ancestresses. Traditionally overshadowed by surname-conferring bloodlines, our matrilineal pedigree remains a vital influence on identity. This essay examines how my own engagement with four hundred years and ten generations of Germanic foremothers connects me to my genetic past, and ten long-lived North Frisian women, in ways likely to elude a genealogist focused on baptizing deceased relations. “Feminist genealogy” pays tribute to the women, named on the bottom of our pedigree charts, who publish their history in our genes."

Stevens"	"SF05044, One of the questions not satisfactorily answered by critics of the Book of Mormon who see the book as a product of Joseph Smith's mind and imagination and his nineteenth-century environs is how he could have found many of the elements in the Book of Mormon (e.g., a knowledge of olive horticulture, Egyptian names, ancient travel routes, knowledge of ancient American culture) in his information environment. If this material was a product of his mind, as some contend, then one has to explain how it got there. This paper takes a look at new scientific explorations into the possibility that one can access information outside one's information environment (both past and future), can receive communication across the liminal threshold between the physical and spiritual worlds, and can tap into “nonlocal” information and experience that may exist on the quantum level. This theory posits that Joseph Smith could have gained access to some realm of consciousness that could be characterized as both trans-spatial and trans-temporal."

For a year and a half, from January 21, 1854 to June 21, 1855, she resided in San Francisco. During that time, she probably recorded more detail about the branch of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which flourished there than did all other extant sources combined. This includes social interaction as well as the regular church meetings, and probably no Mormon visited there during her residence in the city without being noted in her diary. This paper draws from this most insightful document to convey a detailed picture of the branch and its people during that time."

Both patterns can be temporary, decades-long, or lifelong. Both involve the mind, the spirit, and the emotions. Drawing on decades of research in Mormon / LDS / RLDS documents, this paper discusses patterns of doubt and resolution involving devout believers in the Restoration claims and teachings of Joseph Smith Jr. and his successors (as variously defined). The paper then compares those findings with scholarly studies of patterns of doubt and resolution among Christians generally.

Yet Emma Smith was charged with compiling “a selection of sacred hymns . . . which is pleasing unto me, to be had in my church” (D&C 25:11). Eighteenth- and nineteenth- century musical forms and lyrics were dirge-like, focusing on man's evil nature and relief through death. This presentation traces Emma's legacy in creating a new, distinctive genre of sacred music that continues to dominate the LDS hymn tradition. Following this presentation, join in as we do a little “shape note singing,” an exuberant style of community singing and the original form in which many of our favorite hymns were sung."

Using a combination of models that illustrate rational, empirical, and mystical approaches to religion as well as different spiritual temperaments, I will discuss Latter-day Saint connections to the larger religious landscape and explain why I choose Mormonism as a lifestyle"	SW05041	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SW05041.mp3																				THE BATTLE OF CROOKED RIVER: ETHNIC CLEANSING IN 1838 NORTHERN MISSOURI	Mel Tungate	"SW05042, A large volume of poor Mormons moved into Missouri in 1838, and the resulting economic, social, and political tension terminated in a series of small skirmishes which occurred in August through October of 1838. This presentation examines in summary the Mormon raid and cleansing of non-Mormons from Daviess County, Missouri, and will examine in detail Crooked River, where the Mormon troops routed the state troops camped next to the small stream in Ray County, Missouri. The combination of these two attacks resulted in the expulsion of the Mormons from the state of Missouri."

Particularly suggestive is our ability, notably publicized by Cambridge geneticist Bryan Sykes's Seven Daughters of Eve, to track mitochondrial DNA mutations to seven European “clan mothers”, and beyond them, to African ancestresses. Traditionally overshadowed by surname-conferring bloodlines, our matrilineal pedigree remains a vital influence on identity. This essay examines how my own engagement with four hundred years and ten generations of Germanic foremothers connects me to my genetic past, and ten long-lived North Frisian women, in ways likely to elude a genealogist focused on baptizing deceased relations. “Feminist genealogy” pays tribute to the women, named on the bottom of our pedigree charts, who publish their history in our genes."

Stevens"	"SW05044, One of the questions not satisfactorily answered by critics of the Book of Mormon who see the book as a product of Joseph Smith's mind and imagination and his nineteenth-century environs is how he could have found many of the elements in the Book of Mormon (e.g., a knowledge of olive horticulture, Egyptian names, ancient travel routes, knowledge of ancient American culture) in his information environment. If this material was a product of his mind, as some contend, then one has to explain how it got there. This paper takes a look at new scientific explorations into the possibility that one can access information outside one's information environment (both past and future), can receive communication across the liminal threshold between the physical and spiritual worlds, and can tap into “nonlocal” information and experience that may exist on the quantum level. This theory posits that Joseph Smith could have gained access to some realm of consciousness that could be characterized as both trans-spatial and trans-temporal."

For a year and a half, from January 21, 1854 to June 21, 1855, she resided in San Francisco. During that time, she probably recorded more detail about the branch of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which flourished there than did all other extant sources combined. This includes social interaction as well as the regular church meetings, and probably no Mormon visited there during her residence in the city without being noted in her diary. This paper draws from this most insightful document to convey a detailed picture of the branch and its people during that time."

One part of this session will look at what creates spirituality in music and it will also look at how varied music we define as spiritual can be, from towering peaks of Western classical music to hymns, spirituals, Broadway musicals, rock songs and protest music, including the Gospel according to Peter, Paul, and Mary. This session will combine talk, analysis, music, audience participation, and a live performance by singer-songwriter and itinerant biotechnologist Glenn Cornett.

Michael Quinn	"SW05003, Patterns of religious doubt, disbelief, and disaffiliation can be as diverse and interesting as patterns of religious inquiry, faith, and conversion. Both patterns can be temporary, decades-long, or lifelong. Both involve the mind, the spirit, and the emotions. Drawing on decades of research in Mormon / LDS / RLDS documents, this paper discusses patterns of doubt and resolution involving devout believers in the Restoration claims and teachings of Joseph Smith Jr. and his successors (as variously defined). The paper then compares those findings with scholarly studies of patterns of doubt and resolution among Christians generally. As time allows, audience members will be invited to comment, from their own experiences and observations, on the accuracy or applicability of my personal findings and those separate findings by Christian scholars."

Over the past two centuries, he has been portrayed as a great spiritual leader, a prophet, a religious charlatan, and a deeply unstable person. Was he a divine conduit or a mountebank? A caring leader or crafty seducer? Biographers and believers continuously have sought the “real” man beneath the sacred self-descriptions. In this lecture, Laurie Maffly-Kipp suggests that this quest tells us much more about ourselves and our own times than it does about Smith. For believers and nonbelievers, determining Joseph Smith's sincerity is a mighty business. For Mormons, Smith's honesty directly correlates to the honesty of the Latter-day Saint tradition. If Smith really met Moroni, then the basis of Mormonism is confirmed; to distrust Smith's sincerity is to distrust the entire faith system. Likewise, among nonbelievers, doubting Smith's veracity is a key component of their debunking. Regardless of their theological commitments, then, believers and nonbelievers share an obsession with sincerity. Did Joseph Smith mean what he said? Did he feel religious inside? These questions necessarily tempt a far more fundamental query: What is sincere about religion? Moreover, once we move beyond the sincerity polygraph, what remains of Mormonism, and of religious belief more generally? What will we see, about the Mormon faith, about religious sincerity, and about ourselves, if we begin to move beyond this obsession with authenticity?"

Russell	"SL05101, The Bible is full of stories of people, David, Samson, Balaam, Thomas, Judas, of mixed reputation. Let's consider Samson and Thomas. Samson's reputation as a self-centered, hedonistic, prideful, egotist is at odds with God's behavior toward him. Thomas, the doubter, seems to warn us against doing as he did and possibly meriting the same reproof by Jesus. Think doubting might be the first step toward becoming a heretic? Think again."

Such an ontology is “dead” insofar as no reference to the life of a body is required to comprehend it. By contrast, I argue that we need to embrace a living materialism. To be embodied is to have a life. On this view, the claim that the gods and we are embodied is not a metaphysical claim about the ontology of the mind and body but rather a claim about the kind of life we lead."

Mckay's Lessons For Today's Church	Gregory A. Prince	"SL05191, In the epilogue to the book David O. McKay and the Rise of Modern Mormonism, co-author Greg Prince writes of President McKay: David O. McKay inherited a church that was provincial and backward looking. His immediate predecessors wore beards and came from polygamous families, two powerful symbols that were out of touch with modernism. . . . Clean-shaven, immaculately dressed, and movie-star handsome, McKay immediately caught the attention of member and non-member alike, and held it. He democratized Mormonism, . . . [adjusting] the relationship between church and member. . . . He emphasized the paramount importance of free agency and individual expression, for he understood that improvement of the parts would inevitably improve the whole. “Let them conform” was replaced by “Let them grow.” He willingly discarded institutional uniformity for the higher goal of individual excellence. He pitched a wide tent and then told members of all stripes that he welcomed them to join him and build the church within it. In this plenary presentation, Prince will focus on President McKay's leadership within the context of two forms of revelation. He will discuss the first form, “internal” revelatory processes, through the story of the various ways President McKay wrestled with the problems facing the Church because of its policy of withholding priesthood and temple blessings from black members. He will address the second form, “external” processes, in the context of the growth and development of the international church.

Read in the context of a changing American economy, the Book of Mormon can be seen to make a compelling call for national repentance."

Frederick (Toby) Pingree, Nola Wallace, Fred Christensen, Lorie Winder Stromberg, Chase Peterson, Mary Lythgoe Bradford"	"SL05231, This perennially well-received session features the stories of those who have chosen to remain active, dedicated Latter-day Saints even in the face of many difficult challenges to traditional faith.

Pace"	"SL05232, The publication of Martha Beck's Leaving the Saints: How I Lost the Mormons and Found My Faith, has generated intense controversy and conflict, not only for its treatment of Mormonism, but also regarding issues of consistency, disclosure, memory reliability, and the intersection between personal integrity and faith. This panel composed of LDS and non-LDS feminists (male and female) will share their understandings of the book and its personal and collective implications."

Dennis Potter, Blake T. Ostler"	"SL05234, Sterling M. McMurrin once noted that even among the best Mormon theologians, one can find “a confused combination of the entire gamut of atonement theories.” Panelists in this session will attempt to bring forth clarity from this confusion, as well as suggest areas in which Mormonism has made unique contributions to Christology (how Jesus can be both fully divine and fully human) and a deeper understanding of the Atonement."

"Lowell ""Ben"" Bennion, Paul Murphy"	"SL05235, We are at the pioneering stages of embryonic research that promise great medical advancement. However, ethical guidelines have yet to be agreed upon regarding how far we go or how and when we utilize this technology. There is not, as of yet, any established LDS doctrine or official statement regarding the beginning of life nor the pursuance of embryonic research. As Latter-day Saints in and about to enter the medical profession, we believe we need to be proactive in feeling these matters out and deciding how to proceed."

ADair, Marylee Mitcham, Bruce W. Jorgensen"	"SL05236, Retracing his spiritual odyssey, Jack Newell weaves a colorful tapestry that includes a religiously diverse extended family, his Methodist upbringing in rural Ohio, and baptism into the Mormon Church when he was twenty-three years old, in the era of David O. McKay's leadership and High B. Brown's liberal influence. Proceeding through a series of inspiring experiences and baffling incidents as a graduate student, young professor, and college dean in North Carolina, South Carolina, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Utah, he held many leadership positions in branches, wards, and stakes. Never church-broke,” however, he challenged the conservative status quo all along the way, enjoying a few notable successes but more often precipitating humorous results. He traces the evolution of his religiosity to his current way station, where he describes his spirituality as peacefully independent of the Mormon Church."

DAVIES will leada discussion of What the Bleep Do We Know!?,an independent film that has created enormousbuzz, spawning a great spike in interest aboutquantum mechanics and implications emergingfrom that field for our spiritual lives. The film is apart documentary, part story, exploration of thequantum world hidden behind what we know asour normal, waking reality. Grab a quick bite, andthen hurry back (or bring your lunch with you) tojoin fellow Sunstoners in a discussion of the filmand its connections with Mormonism and otherissues.

Michael Quinn	"SL05251, It has been thirty-one years since Jan Shipps issued a challenge in her essay, “The Prophet Puzzle,” for writers to develop thorough portraits of Joseph Smith that show the “whole man.” Although more biographies are scheduled for release by year's end, this paper examines the strengths and weaknesses of nine post-1974 biographies of the founding Mormon prophet."

Stevens"	"SL05252, Although some prefer to think of religious organizations as fundamentally different from other types of organizations, they all face similar issues of structure, staffing and supervision, positioning and marketing of services, and management development. This interactive presentation highlights some of the organizational challenges facing the Church as it pursues its twenty-first century mission, asking audience members to join in imagining a role as Church management consultant."

The Role Of Reason In Living The Gospel	"Janice Allred, Bill Hansen"	"SL05253, Does faith seek understanding? Does understanding support faith? The scriptures contain many affirmations of the value of the intellect, yet there is a strong anti-intellectual strain in Mormonism. This paper argues that reason plays an essential role in living the gospel."

Do some Mormon cultural “mantras”, repetitive phrases and ideas that organize the internal lives of many Latter-day Saints, serve the same liberating function, or do they, at times, inhibit individual spiritual growth? Are there gospel mantras that could better serve us?"	SL05254	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL05254.mp3																				Divine Inspiration Or Devilish Deception? Interpreting Religious Experience	Brian Birch	"SL05255, What is the relationship between feeling the spirit and knowing that a teaching is true?

Stuy"	"SL05262, Mormonism is known for its often unique and idiosyncratic use of standard Christian vocabulary. This paper looks at the interpretations of some standard Mormon “proof texts” and considers some of the most widespread and egregiously misunderstood passages that bear directly on Mormon belief and practice."

Jess Groesbeck, David Clark Knowlton"	"SL05263, This presentation continues my consideration of the merits of the paradigmatic model of Joseph Smith as a shamanic personality as the most comprehensible way to understand and embrace his life and work. Utilizing the research of C.G.. Jung and Mircea Eliade and others on archetypal patterns of ancient religions and healing practices, this session furthers the attempt to integrate the most disparate aspects of Joseph's life for a better understanding of him."

Ostler"	"SL05265, LDS scholars have frequently asserted that the Mormon understanding of salvation is very much akin to the Armenian Protestant tradition in a number of points. This is essentially correct. In fact, I believe Mormonism can be seen as a very radical form of Arminianism (or as “hyper”-Armenian) and that the most important theological dividing line is between Calvinism/Augustinianism and the worldview shared by Arminianism and Mormonism."

Benson Whittle, C. Jess Groesbeck, and others, have repositioned Joseph Smith as an intuitive voice working within alternative worldviews or traditions, such as folk magic, hermeticism, creative imagination, literary genius, myth, and vision.

"Boyd Jay Petersen, Eric Samuelsen, Janet Garrard-Willis, Vaughn Cook, Pat Jones, Scott Howell"	"SL05272, In April 1998, Elder Marlin K. Jensen told the Salt Lake Tribune that Church leaders feel “it's not in the best interest [of the Church] to be known as a one-party church.” With the rise of Senator Harry Reid to Senate minority leader, and with a growing disenchantment with Bush administration policies on faith-based initiatives, stem cell research, and the Patriot Act, are we at the beginning of a new era for Mormon Democrats?"

Kesler"	"SL05274, Ken Wilber is considered by many to be the world's foremost integral theorist, someone who, according to Huston Smith, has “book by book [been] laying the grounds for a genuine world integration.” So, who is Ken Wilber? What are the basic premises of his integral vision? Panelists will talk about what attracted them to Wilber's work, why they value his approach and insights, and why other Latter-day Saints might enjoy reading him, too."

Parker Blount, Margaret Blair Young, Darius Gray"	"SL05291, This is Sunstone's perennially best-attended session. Hear speakers share the events and concepts that animate their religious lives; a little soul-baring, a little spiritual journey, a little intellectual testimony-bearing. This self-reflective night is about the things that matter most, plus spirited congregational hymn-singing."

Jody England Hansen	"SL05301, All the scriptures that refer to turning hearts are used to support genealogy and temple work, but I think there is a more extensive message. The turning hearts verses have become, to me, some of the fundamental scriptures about the Atonement, especially at the level at which we are asked to live it in this world. The benefits and the consequences of how we choose to live the Atonement have become an interesting part of my scripture reading. Far more is at stake than getting my family group sheets filled out."

"S. Eugene Needham, Scot Denhalter"	"SL05314, 'I Can Show It From The Bible.' In one of Joseph Smith's two most famous discourses on polytheism, he insisted he could “show it from the Bible.” Can a plurality of Gods be shown from the so-claimed monotheistic Bible? If it can be shown from the Bible, should the doctrine become scripture? What could an acceptance of the plurality of Gods mean to Mormon doctrine?"

Even in the darkest events, the Mountain Meadows Massacre, for example, Mormon ancestors can and do emerge for me in the fullness of their humanity as understandable, sympathetic, and even heroic."

Michael Quinn"	"SL05321, Why is Joseph Smith still remembered when many other would be prophets and religious innovators have faded into obscurity? I believe much of the answer lies in the symbiosis of leader and follower that worked to shape the stories Joseph Smith told about himself. If this is so, will we ever be able to know the 'real' Joseph smith?"

Parker Blount"	"SL05322, Former nun Karen Armstrong writes that she “failed” at every important endeavor she undertook until she began exploring the value of religion and the idea of God not from the viewpoint of a specific doctrine, but from the position of someone baffled by her own experiences and open to the doubts and beliefs of others. She is now one of the world's most important and renowned scholars of religion. This presentation provides an overview of some of her significant questions and insights."

Carlisle Hunsaker, Stephen Clark"	"SL05323, As a missionary serving in England, Ed Firmage was struck profoundly by the Apostle Paul's teaching that we are all part of a new nation in Christ, that he “hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us” (Ephesians 2:14). Since that time, much that he has done, his human rights and political activism that led him from the White House and Hubert Humphrey to Roy Wilkins and the NAACP to the forefront of Utah campaigns on race, ethnicity, gender, the MX missile, freedom of conscience, speech, and the separation of church and state, and gay and lesbian issues, has flown forth from this sense of a universal humanity. Ed's sense of our deep connection with all others has also led him to intense studies of Merton, Jung, and Gandhi, and also to an association and enduring friendship with the Dalai Lama."

Shirts	"SL05326, On first blush, Joseph Smith's interpretations of the facsimiles in the Book of Abraham appear to contradict what Egyptologists say they are and what they mean. But are they really all that wrong? A broader understanding of ancient Egyptological religion explains the contradictions quite well."

Parker Blount, Lisa Tensmeyer Hansen, Ricardo Diaz, Christopher K. Bigelow, Paul Montclair, Marybeth Raynes"	"SL05331, There are now a number of biographies painting a different picture of Joseph Smith than that which is typically presented at church. What should one make of the differing accounts of the first vision, Joseph's version of celestial marriage, peep stones and magic, for example? This session asks active Latter-day Saint panelists to focus on how they view Joseph and affirm his prophetic role in light of their exposure to widely varying portrayals."

Smith, Megan Falater"	"SL05332, Through interrogating stories told by white Latter-day Saints to explain racial difference and justify subordinating and excluding people of color from full participation in the Church, this panel seeks to understand the past and present “place” of people of color in Mormonism, including how minority members and converts were and are viewed, understood, conceptualized, and defined by the Church hierarchy and the general membership."

But in cultures where doubting is considered a serious defect, people find themselves facing ethical dilemmas about how much, if anything, to say to family, friends, and Church leaders. This panel discusses how different Latter-day Saints have faced the challenges of dealing ethically with themselves and those around them. It also inquires about the specific difficulties faced by those who first begin doubting at different ages."

Rees, Hugo Olaiz, Ron Schow, Bill Bradshaw"	"SL05336, This past year has seen the publication of In Quiet Desperation: Understanding the Challenges of Same-Gender Attraction and A Guide for Latter-day Saint Families Dealing with Homosexual Attraction.

Pace, Cheryl Pace"	"SL05352, Are Mormons a self-hating people, just as, arguably, blacks and women once were? We believe they are.

Roberts	"SL05356, The classical Hebrew prophets contributed greatly to the intellectual and spiritual foundations of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Though their messages are ancient, their relevance is modern, for the prophets were “dissident intellectuals” who taught us by their examples to challenge both religious and political authorities.

Rees, Ron Romig"	"SL05361, How do we visualize the Prophet? From early drawings, sketches, political cartoons, daguerreotypes, and eyewitness descriptions to modern artistic renditions in film and poetry, the Prophet has been portrayed variously as heroic, comic, demonic, and at times, plainly human. What do these portraits tell us about the Prophet and ways in which he saw himself, the ways others saw him, and the ways in which we see him today?"

"John Williams, John-Charles Duffy"	"SL05363, What exactly are the consequences in assuming that the Book of Mormon is “true”? Does it matter if it is not? What are the strengths and weaknesses of arguments for a compromise? If the only real test for Book of Mormon historicity lies in the nebulous realm of spiritual authentication, how much of the discursive and messy practice of “history” do we attribute to the text?"

Stevens"	"SL05365, Since all collective organizations inevitably generate and exercise power, some inquiry into the basis of LDS power seems germane. More specifically, what is the nature of the Mormon priesthood? Does the Church enjoy a unique authorization to act for God? Beyond the obvious function of the priesthood as a mechanism for Church governance, does it embody spiritual power unavailable to non-Mormons, and to women? Are there other “power tools” the Church employs to compel the hearts and minds of its members?"

An explosion of outrage tore the community apart, and those once apathetic to political views rose to the front lines. And so began a heated war of protests, lawsuits, and death threats.

An explosion of outrage tore the community apart, and those once apathetic to political views rose to the front lines. And so began a heated war of protests, lawsuits, and death threats. Would conservative activists prevent Michael Moore from coming? Would liberal Utahans win their fight for Freedom of speech? The answer lies somewhere within This Divided State."

To us, he was not a contemporary leader in LDS academia but an established icon whose greatest works had already been published, more of a force than a person.

Jackson Newell	"SL05391, Retracing his spiritual odyssey, Jack Newell weaves a colorful tapestry that includes a religiously diverse extended family, his Methodist upbringing in rural Ohio, and baptism into the Mormon Church when he was twenty-three years old—in the era of David O. McKay’s leadership and High B. Brown’s liberal influence. Proceeding through a series of inspiring experiences and baffling incidents as a graduate student, young professor, and college dean in North Carolina, South Carolina, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Utah, he held many leadership positions in branches, wards, and stakes. Never “church-broke,” however, he challenged the conservative status quo all along the way, enjoying a few notable successes but more often precipitating humorous results. He traces the evolution of his religiosity to his current way station, where he describes his spirituality as peacefully independent of the Mormon Church."

During the decade between 1972 and 1982, when ratification efforts had failed, the United Nations created a National Commission to organize a National Women's Year, a national convention for women, and state conventions to study the key issues impacting the lives of American women.

As the founding member of the visionary rock group The New York Dolls, Arthur “Killer” Kane belonged to a select group of musicians widely credited as the definitive proto-glam-punkensemble. The Dolls pioneered a look and sound that paved the way for the punk and glam rock Dolls look-alikes who would follow in the next decade. Unfortunately, like many other bands, the Dolls crashed and burned amidst a flurry of drug and alcohol abuse. Fast forward thirty years, and find 55-year-old Arthur riding the bus to his job at the LDS Family History Center Library in Los Angeles. Arthur had converted to Mormonism in 1989 after answering an ad in Reader’s Digest. He’s somewhat content but still dreaming of reuniting with the Dolls and returning to life as a musician. Enter Greg Whiteley, a filmmaker and member of Arthur’s ward, who believes Arthur’s life story would make a wonderful short documentary and begins interviewing him. As they are moving ahead with this project, they learn that Morrissey, the legendary former lead singer of The Smiths and a huge fan of the Dolls, would like to have the band reunite for ahuge music festival in London he is organizing. This breaking news, combined with the fact that Whiteley’s interviews with Arthur were beginning to “look like a film,” emboldens the filmmaker to envision his modest project more ambitiously. What had initially begun as a short profile of Arthur’s strange journey from rock god to lost soul to LDS Family History worker was becoming a bigger idea. The final film, New York Doll, is an 76-minute documentary that has excited audiences at festivals, including the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, and in theatrical release. The film features interviews about the Dolls and Arthur with rock legends Morrissey, Bob Geldolf, Chrissie Hynde, Mick Jones, Iggy Pop, and others. It also features interviews with Arthur’s friends at the Family History Library (who pitch in to help Arthur get his guitars out of hock so he can begin practicing for the reunion) and depicts many poignant moments leading up to Arthur’s reunion with the other surviving members of the Dolls and their triumphant comeback at the 2004 Meltdown Festival."

It was a time of great transitions for Hugh. He began his Claremont tenure with anti-Semitic attitudes (ironic given his own Jewish ancestry) but left with a deep respect for all things Jewish. He began at Claremont an eager academic; he left with a deep cynicism toward intellectual life. He began at Claremont with a deep love for Germany (having served his LDS mission to Germany only eight years earlier); after teaching with many Jewish-German emigres, he left with a distrust for Germany. Still Hugh Nibley's attitudes toward war, wealth, and the environment were present even then. And his devotion to the Mormon church was just as strong."

This discussion will explore why some LDS women have chosen Wiccan and similar practices as either supplements to or replacements for their Mormonism. How and where were these women exposed to these new beliefs and practices? How do they characterize their new identity? What impact have these spiritual-religious changes had on their families? How do those who have chosen to remain LDS view their relationship to the Church and church activity? Do they see their practices as acts of apostasy?"

Dennis Potter and Scot Denhalter	"SW06004, MORMON STUDIES AS CULTURAL STUDIES: THE AMERICANIZATION OF MORMONISM REFLECTED IN POP CULTURE Cultural studies is an interdisciplinary approach to studying human life that employs political theory and strategy, as well as philosophy, anthropology, literary criticism, religious studies, and other fields. Its approach is unabashedly political in nature. Its purpose is to show how cultural representations in human life serve to reinforce power structures that marginalize some and centralize others. Once marginalized but now centralized in the American culture, Mormonism is a very interesting case study for this type of critique. I believe we can learn much about Mormonism's relationship to networks of American power through reflection on the ultra-positive representations of Mormons in pop culture. I will use as a case example the 'All about the Mormons' episode of the popular, animated comedy, South Park."

His presentation will describe how he became interested in the field and some of the perils of discussing his chosen subject, formally and informally, with fellow outsiders and LDS Church members. These challenges, generally, the skepticism of outsiders and the faith-promoting interests of members, serve as a microcosm of some of the questions of method and audience which loom large for a non-Mormon just starting out in the field. The interpretive problems that beset the academic study of religion, issues of faith and scholarship, of the status of insiders and outsiders, of the parochialism that religion tends to bring out in scholars as much as in everyone else, are displayed in particularly stark relief with respect to the study of Mormonism, and are significant challenges to a student looking for a voice and audience within the evolving discipline."

John Williams	"SW06006, HITCHCOCK AND MORMONISM Which Alfred Hitchcock film contains a long passage from the Book of Mormon, and how and why did it get into the film? What Mormon actors have starred in Hitchcock films? What Mormon artist created the largest work of art featured in any of Hitchcock's films? What Mormon screenwriter wrote several episodes of the Alfred Hitchcock Presents TV series? What did Hitchcock think of Mormonism? In attempting to answer these questions, I will also explore some aspects of contemporary film theory and ask what it means, in turn, for the pinnacle of Mormon religious expression to involve the watching of a film. Hitchcock's films, I will argue, have something to teach us about what it means to be a Mormon in an age of mechanical reproduction."

Compton	"SW06007, Hugh Nibley gave a series of talks about sophic and mantic insociety: the sophic offers the shallow, deceitful cleverness of PRand spin, which often leads to success in this world while themantic (from Greek mantis, “seer”) looks to the eternal vision ofthings. My new book, Victim of the Muses (see WWW.HUP.HARVARD.EDU/CATALOG/COMVIC.HTML), looks at the origins of poetics in western civilization in this perspective.The poet as prophet, Marsyas, Aesop, or Socrates, grotesquely uglyand a warrior with words, was often offensive to sophic societyand became the pharmakos, or scapegoat, killed or cast out bypolitical leaders.

What is the relationship between history and faith, andis Mormonism and the faith of its members tied more closely tothe historical record than they are in most other traditions?

Why the buzz? The show centers on the family of Bill Hendrickson, the owner of a growing chain of home improvement stores who owns three homes of his own, each occupied by one of his wives and their children. HBO is known for producing series that explore unusual families (The Sopranos, Six Feet Under) but suburban polygamy? The family's lifestyle is informed by Mormonism. In the second episode, it is revealed that at age fourteen, Bill, like other young men, was cast out of the fundamentalist Mormon polygamous community in which he was raised because senior leaders didn’t want competition for younger wives. And they practice religious devotions such as personal prayer, grace at meals, and spiritual blessings. But they are not portrayed as Mormons nor even as typical fundamentalists. They don't attend church nor wear temple garments, and only one family member, second wife Nikki (whose father is the prophet/leader of the community that ostracized Bill),dresses anything like what one usually associates with fundamentalist Mormon women. Still, the show is set in Utah with Mormon references popping up everywhere, a prayer in which Bill expresses gratitude for their being a family sealed for 'time and all eternity,' casual references to Relief Society, Young Women's, Mormon bishops, teen slang terms such as 'Morg' and 'Morbot' for super-devout LDS, the local high school's name and mascot: the 'Cumorah Cougars.' Given its uncomfortable history with its polygamist past and the great lengths the LDS Church has gone to in order to distinguish today's Mormonism from its nineteenth-century incarnation, LDS leaders are quite uncomfortable with the series, urging producers to place disclaimers in the credits and issuing statements to the press and local Mormon leaders clarifying the current LDS stance toward the practice of polygamy. In contrast, however, some Latter-day Saints are quietly pleased that Big Love has come along because it is forcing a fresh discussion of polygamy and the difficult balancing act Church leaders have tried to perform this past century of renouncing the practice while never denouncing the doctrine of plural marriage. In this session, we're pleased to have the opportunity to talk about the series and the issues it raises. How many families like the Hendricksons live in the United States today? How accurate are the series' portrayals of the joys and trials of plural families? What might the fallout, both positive and negative, be for the LDS Church should the series become a hit and genuine player in America's culture wars?"

The most important set of LDS interests is represented by 'faithful scholarship,' which has come to set the standard of acceptable scholarship about Mormonism for many Latter-day Saints poised to help shape the emerging subfield as scholars, students, donors, and local community constituents. How did faithful scholarship become the dominant normative model for LDS scholars, replacing relatively more anti-intellectual and more naturalistic outlooks in the process?

While many political theologies are often either positive or negative toward involvement, LDS doctrine seems to have characteristics of both. In this paper, I compare Joseph Smith's teachings with Jacob Taubes's “radical” reading of St. Paul. Taubes, a Jewish philosopher, argues that Paul's Epistle to the Romans expresses a negative political theology. Building on Richard Lloyd Anderson's argument that Paul and Smith have much in common, I use Taubes's perspectives as a tool for identifying aspects of negative political theology in LDS teachings which, despite appearances to the contrary, seem to underlie and, in a sense, override the better-known and more frequently quoted aspects of positive political theology."

Now I teach religious studies' students at Utah Valley State College, and I find that many of these students who share the passion I had for religious studies are the very ones who are leaving the Church. In this session, I will share some of their feelings (gathered through personal interviews) and contrast them with my own personal faith journey. Kimball- Boyd Petersen and I became friends sixteen years ago when we both lived near Washington D.C. I was experiencing a crisis of faith, and Boyd served as a much-needed sounding board. Through the ensuing years, Boyd's presence in my life provided a bandage for my wounded and bleeding faith, allowing me to feel connected to the Church even while doubting. Still, not until I was introduced to James Fowler's Stages of Faith some seven years later did I feel permission to fully expose my wounds, to truly face the loss of my faith altogether, so they could actually heal. Fowler's work and my mentoring friend gave me the tools I needed to find a meaningful place within my tradition."

More than twenty films have emerged since then, some produced to have crossover appeal (e.g., On the Other Side of Heaven and Dutcher's films, including his newest, States of Grace), others unabashedly insular, relying on Mormon in-humor and banking on LDS religiosity (e.g., The Singles Ward, The R.M., Day of Defense). Where do things stand at Mormon Cinema's five-year mark?

Until now, the impact of these stories ontypical Mormon discourse has been minimal. Perhaps it was thefront-page placement of Lobdell’s story, perhaps it was the tug ofthe human stories it told of Native American and Polynesian Latter-day Saints who had once thought they were Lamanitesand now are not so sure, or perhaps it is simply that multipleexposures to the issue are now having a cumulative effect, but itseems that this latest story has begun to reach the ears of andunsettle more Latter-day Saints than ever before. (One evidencefor this is the Church’s adding links on its official website,www.lds.org, to seven additional and often more aggressive andspeculative responses to the DNA studies than the four it hashad links to for the past several years.)In this session, we welcome William Lobdell who will share withus the story of how he came to write this article as well as abouthis experiences in its wake.

The latter work, while not a biography, focuses on Smith and the controversies and contradictions surrounding his activities in establishing Mormonism.

A common feature of academic scholarship written on Mormonism has been to highlight its unique theology in which God the Father not only possesses a physical body but we, as his children, have the potential to progress and become as he is: Gods and Goddesses. Some of these scholars have used this as an opportunity to classify Mormonism as being a polytheistic religion. Not only does such a classification misrepresent Mormonism, its worship practices and beliefs, the polytheistic label also dislocates the religion from its socio-historical context and presents it as a religion more akin to paganism than Christianity."

Very little Angels scholarship has focused on religion and, in particular, the play's engagement with revelation in a Mormon context. This presentation seeks to step into this void by exploring how Angels, considered by many to be a canonically queer text, constructs the feminine by engaging revelation as both an agent of feminine pathologization and a vehicle for creating gendered transformations that matter."

Isn't that somewhat literalistic and naive? How can something as large as Divinity be limited to something so grossly earthy as a body with genitals?” This presentation explores the ramifications of these questions: Why is an embodied God usually seen as inferior to a God beyond categories? And why has the transcendent God usually been pictured as male? Is it necessary to redeem the idea of embodiment to redeem women?"

Roberts remains a significant Mormon historian and theologian, and he's considered one of the Church's premier intellectuals. This presentation draws on my experience as the editor of his journals covering the period from 1880â€“1898, a crucial period in LDS history. The journals tells us much about Roberts' early life, his growth from young missionary to general authority, but also illuminates his struggle with Church officials over politics and his resistance to the Woodruff Manifesto which ended the practice of polygamy. In short, they offer new clues into the life of one of Mormonism's leading thinkers and help us better understand his impact on the times in which he lived."

More than twenty films have been released since then, some produced to have crossover appeal (e.g., On the Other Side of Heaven and Dutcher's films, including his newest, States of Grace), others unabashedly insular, relying on Mormon in-humor and banking on LDS religiosity (e.g., The Singles Ward, The R.M., Day of Defense). Where do things stand at Mormon Cinema's five-year mark?

"Dan Wotherspoon, Bengt Washburn, John Hatch, Mark I. Pinsky"	"SL06091, Religion and Pop Culture: Shotgun Wedding, Marriage of Convenience, or Match Made in Heaven? We've come a long way since Hollywood's idea of religion was confined to biblical sand-and-sword operas; Irish priests and chaplains with twinkly eyes; and morally corrupt Protestant evangelists like Elmer Gantry. Barely a month passes without a movie or television show that portrays people of faith, often in a favorable light. By the same token, Christian creators of alternative culture have come a long way from showing Billy Graham studio movies in church basements; producing feel-good, uplifting television dramas for the Sunday morning broadcast ghetto; or publishing treacly books that sell only because they are “Christian.” Popular culture has experienced a seismic shift in the past two decades, thanks in part to the global market economy. Commercial producers now recognize that evangelical Christians constitute a lucrative, discrete market that will respond if the product appeals to them. And sophisticated evangelicals have learned that if their production values are equal to the marketplace, their movies, TV shows, music, books, radio stations, and stand-up comics can enable them to protect their constituency from the toxic popular culture. As an unintended consequence, the best of their creations can provide effective outreach for the unchurched. Join celebrated religion writer and astute media observer Mark Pinsky for a fascinating tour through this shifting terrain as he explores what lies ahead. Is this just a blip, or is there a fundamental change in American popular culture, one that integrates faith and religion as part of the landscape? Will ensemble television comedies and dramas now have “the Christian” as a stock character, the way many now have “the gay character”? If Christian movie producers like Walden, or commercial studios, produce a string of high-budget bombs at the box office, will this trend come to a screeching halt? With at least one comic book hero, a Mormon named “Cypher” from the New Mutants, and the incredible success of Napoleon Dynamite, will LDS characters go mainstream? It's worked that way before for evangelical Protestants. Ned Flanders, Homer Simpson's goofy next door neighbor, put a human and humorous face on evangelicals for people whose only previous exposure was to dour, cable TV gasbags. Although skeptical at first, church youth workers on college campuses found that young Christians had recognized in Ned a kindred spirit and had adopted him as a lovable mascot. At least one prominent Protestant mega-church pastor likes to wear a “Vote for Pedro” T-shirt. Mark I. Pinsky's journalism career began in the 1960s at Duke University, where he wrote a column called “The Readable Radical” for the campus daily. After graduation, he worked for several underground papers before heading to Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism and respectability by earning his M.S.J. Mark spent most of the 1970s in the Southeast as a free lance writer, primarily covering racial and criminal justice trials and focusing on the death penalty for outlets like the New York Times. After living and working in China in 1982-83, his first regular, full-time job came in 1985, staff writer for the Los Angeles Times' Orange County Edition. At the Times, he wrote about religion, the performing arts and philanthropy and, again, courts and criminal justice. Mark became religion writer and senior reporter at the Orlando Sentinel in 1995, specializing in coverage of evangelical Christianity in the Sun Belt."

It is not a simple matter to bear testimony, let alone understand what is asked of us, and especially difficult for a child to grasp. To whom do we testify? Of what do we testify? Why must everyone testify? The original sense of the Latin testis was “one standing as a third, in reference to the witness standing as a third entity in a lawsuit.” That raises other questions: Who is the judge?

But what about the man in the midst of this flurry of activity? In his March 1987 Sunstone reflection, son Edward L. Kimball suggested that several personal characteristics animated his father's service as Church president: he loved to interact with people; he had a sense of humor; he had a feeling of personal insignificance or inadequacy; he tried harder than anyone else.

Scot Denhalter's presentation focuses on the musings of Princeton moral philosopher Henry G. Frankfurt about a quality of misrepresentation that falls on the continuum between telling the truth and lying (somewhere just short of a lie), which he names “bullshit.” Denhalter asks if this type of discourse exists in Mormon culture and, if so, to what extent? Is there a different type of it in Mormonism than is found elsewhere? Does the Church employ social mechanisms that increase or decrease the incidence of “b.s.” in Mormon culture? Ryan Wimmer explores a religious principle, taqiyah, that Shi'a Muslims use as a means to protect their faith. Taqiyah means to “safeguard or defend” as well as “to fear” (as in the sense of being pious) and allows members of the faith to be untruthful when their life or religious faith is in danger. Wimmer argues that a similar principle exists in Mormonism, though it's unnamed and has yet to achieve a recognized status as an aid to faith.

By the same token, too many intellectuals have as cavalierly dismissed Mormonism's fundamental truth claims.

The story eventually made headlines in Time magazine, the Washington Post, and the Chronicle of Higher Education, among numerous other publications, and was declared one of Utah's Top Five Stories of the Year. Joseph Vogel, the former student body vice president primarily responsible for the decision to invite Moore, and author of the recently published book, Free Speech 101, will speak of this experience and what it revealed about such significant issues as culture and religion, diversity and tolerance, faith and fear."

As part of an effort to build a comparative erotics, this paper works from a close reading of key Latter-day Saint texts, such as “A Proclamation to the World”, in conjunction with Mormon folklore and empirical studies of Mormon sexuality to elicit a model of Mormon erotics and its relationship to the building of a Latter-day Saint society."

This presentation focuses on four of them, Tamar, Rachab, Ruth, and Bathsheba, who, though chosen as members of the most royal of lineages, are largely ignored today, apparently not considered proper examples for LDS women and men to follow. What is it about these four that causes them to be ignored? What qualities did they have that may have led Matthew to include them? I suggest that their stories are more relevant to Latter-day Saints than the pristine caricatures of women that are often held up as models in today's Mormonism."

Wotherspoon speaks of his own sustained immersion in liminality and talks of a community that is created by like-minded searchers. But, by definition, can liminality be sustained? Is it more likely that someone born into Mormonism will be a liminalist longer than would a convert, especially in evaluating the truth claims of the faith? Is this related to the processes involved in resolving inner conflicts? What role does courage play in the conclusions one comes to? This presentation is from two perspectives: that of a father who is still part of the community Wotherspoon describes, and that of a son who has observed the community from the outside, more as an alien anthropologist."

Toward Healthy Communication With Teenagers About Sex Most Latter-day Saint parents would rather talk about anything with their children other than sexual desire. Is it because we have only one context in which to put the experience of sexual feelings outside marriage: sin? We recognize the potency of our drives and the complex consequences that follow from sexual activity before a person is ready, so it's natural that we are hesitant to let teenagers loose in such a charged area. But are there healthy ways to talk with our teenagers and young adult children about sex? Does Mormonism have resources for a better framing of intense sexual interest than its being Satan's most effective means of leading people carefully into hell? Dante only got to heaven by first journeying into hell. How can we be better Virgil's, better guides for our teenagers as they negotiate the difficult terrain of sexual desire?"

As the founding member of the visionary rock group The New York Dolls, Arthur “Killer” Kane belonged to a select group of musicians widely credited as the definitive proto-glam-punk ensemble. The Dolls pioneered a look and sound that paved the way for the punk and glam rock Dolls look-alikes who would follow in the next decade. Unfortunately, like many other bands, the Dolls crashed and burned amidst a flurry of drug and alcohol abuse. Fast forward thirty years, and find 55-year-old Arthur riding the bus to his job at the LDS Family History Center Library in Los Angeles. Arthur had converted to Mormonism in 1989 after answering an ad in TV Guide. His life is calmer, but he still dreams of reuniting with the Dolls and returning to life as a musician. Enter Greg Whiteley, a filmmaker and member of Arthur's ward, who believes Arthur's life story would make a wonderful short documentary and begins interviewing him. As they are moving ahead with this project, they learn that Morrissey, the legendary former lead singer of The Smiths and a huge fan of the Dolls, would like to have the band reunite for a huge music festival in London he is organizing. This breaking news, combined with the fact that Whiteley's interviews with Arthur were beginning to “look like a film,” emboldens the filmmaker to envision his modest project more ambitiously. What had initially begun as a short profile of Arthur's strange journey from rock god to lost soul to LDS Family History worker was becoming a bigger idea. The completed film, New York Doll, is a 76-minute documentary that has excited audiences at festivals, including the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, and in theatrical release. The film features interviews about the Dolls and Arthur with rock legends Morrissey, Bob Geldolf, Chrissie Hynde, Mick Jones, Iggy Pop, and others. It also features interviews with Arthur's friends at the Family History Library (who pitch in to help Arthur get his guitars out of hock so he can begin practicing for the reunion). The film depicts many poignant moments leading up to Arthur's reunion with the other surviving members of the Dolls and their triumphant comeback at the 2004 Meltdown Festival."

The Conflict Between Gender Difference And Equality In Mormonism This presentation examines three sets of related inquiries to the question, “Are boys more important than girls?” (1) What kind of equality does God's justice demand to fulfill the scriptural exhortation that we are all “alike unto God”? Can gender difference and equality coexist? (2) Can equality be measured objectively? Are there certain criteria we should look for? Do we find them in the Church? Or is equality a subjective matter? If LDS women feel equal, is that sufficient? (3) Does the Church have the moral duty to promote equality within its organization?

The resulting public scare, though limited, was born of a mixture of anti-cult activity, political interests, a helping of sensation-making journalism, and the distinctly American image of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Regarding doctrine, Joseph Smith saw the Church and the Latter-day Saints themselves in the stage of infancy. According to him, there is a vast reservoir of religious knowledge available to any who ask and seek and are prepared to receive. Given Smith's many declarations, why don't we see more diversity among today's Latter-day Saints?"

The Dilemma For Mormon Artists And Whether There's A Way Out Why do so many Mormon artists find themselves torn between the Church and their art, feeling that they're leading two very different lives that are difficult to reconcile? Why do so many of us feel that we have to make a choice between being loyal to their Church and loyal to their art? Is it simply that, as the Bible suggests, “No man can serve to masters, for either he will hate the one and despise the other, or he will hold to the one and despise the other”? Is Art a master that challenges faith and God? Or is it more complicated than that? Orson F. Whitney suggested that Mormonism would “yet have Miltons and Shakespeares of our own” and for years people have been talking about the “Great Mormon Novel” being just on the horizon. Yet is it really possible for a great artist to exist within a religious structure such as Mormonism? Brian Evenson will talk about the pressures he experienced when his first book, Altmann's Tongue, cost him his job at Brigham Young University, and the path he followed from feeling that he could personally reconcile his art and his faith to being put in a position where he felt like he had to make a choice between the two. Are there ways of thinking about the relation between faith and art that will allow us not to compromise either, that can allow for a symbiotic relationship that a religious structure can not only understand but encourage?

To understand Church responses to this crisis, I analyzed all general conference talks and Improvement Era and Ensign articles on gender from 1940 to 2006. They show the Church harshly criticizing change, then accommodating it without really changing, and finally creating a new boundary between itself and its social environment. By stressing the positive aspects of its difference with contemporary society, the Church convinced members to adhere to doctrines that might otherwise have resulted in a loss of authority."

My new book, Victim of the Muses, looks at the origins of poetics in western civilization from this perspective. The poet as prophet (Marsyas, Aesop, or Socrates, grotesquely ugly and a warrior with words) was often offensive to sophic society and became the pharmakos, or scapegoat, killed or cast out by political leaders.

Why the buzz? The show centers on the family of Bill Hendrickson, the owner of a growing chain of home-improvement stores who owns three homes of his own, each occupied by one of his wives and their children. HBO is known for producing series that explore unusual families (The Sopranos, Six Feet Under). But suburban polygamy? Given its uncomfortable history with its polygamist past and the great lengths the Church has gone to in order to distinguish today's Mormonism from its nineteenth-century incarnation, LDS leaders have been less than comfortable with the series, urging producers to place disclaimers in the credits and issuing statements to the press and local Mormon leaders clarifying the current LDS stance toward the practice of polygamy. In contrast, however, some Latter-day Saints are quietly pleased that Big Love has come along because it is forcing a fresh discussion of polygamy and the difficult balancing act Church leaders have tried to perform over the past century of renouncing the practice while never denouncing the doctrine of plural marriage. In this session, panelists will talk about the series and the issues it raises. How many families like the Hendricksons live in the United States today?

This presentation examines long-ignored evidence identifying what was wrong with what Danish handcart pioneer John A.

These are: (1) the lust for sexual purity (what I call “schoolmarmery”), (2) the obsession with material success (“success-mongery”), and (3) the demand for infallible leadership (“sycophancy”).

Foxe	"SL06261, The Promise And Peril Of The Internet Within Mormonism The Internet presents considerable promise and peril within Mormonism. Over the past fifteen years, LDS-themed web sites, forums, blogs, podcasts, and wikis have emerged, each technology developing a unique set of cultural and social implications for Latter-day Saints. In 2006, new technologies and services such as YouTube.com (free online video), Facebook/MySpace (Social Networking), Del.icio.us (social tagging), Digg.com (peer production news), and Flickr (photos) are emerging, each presenting additional opportunities and challenges. This presentation is a multimedia “year in review” of Mormonism on the Internet, along with a sneak preview of what is to come in 2007, and beyond. Please bring your questions and ideas about these technologies and their possibilities!"

Bush"	"SL06262, My Creed: Writing One's Personal Articles Of Faith For millennia, Christians have distilled their beliefs into short statements, similar to Joseph Smith's Articles of Faith. While the practice of a committee imposing a creedal statement of belief on members is anathema to Mormons, the use of the literary form of the creed by individuals is a helpful spiritual discipline. It forces one to confront the questions “Just what do I believe?” and “What are the issues, ideas, and concepts that animate my religious life?” The sharing of these core religious doctrines and ideas from one person's life inspires others."

If we live long enough and try hard enough, we may find time and opportunity to talk about everything: the sacred, the secret, the hard. Clifton Jolley has needed six children and two religions to begin the conversation. This paper is one of a collection of alternating personal essays for a book of the same title Jolley is writing with one of his six children, his eldest son."

Stuy	"SL06264, 'I Myself Serve The Law Of God But With The Flesh The Law Of Sin': Joseph Smith Edits Paul's Letter To The Romans, 1832-33 As part of his revision of the King James Bible, Joseph Smith made significant edits to Paul's letter to the Romans. Because of the theological significance of Romans in Christian history and the nature of Joseph's edits, this part of his biblical revision is of a different sort than other, more expansive portions such as the Book of Moses. Although Joseph's method, the actual correcting of the Bible text, was characteristically idiosyncratic, it certainly wasn't without analogues, particularly in the context of growing nineteenth-century doubts about scriptural purity and worries about the pitfalls of translation. How does Joseph's work fit in with these worries and other attempts to answer theological questions by making adjustments to scripture?"

He was poet in residence for several years in BYU's English Department. Though he never joined the LDS Church, he got along famously with and mentored many of his Mormon colleagues, students, and neighbors. Hear what his friends have to say about this anomalous figure whose influence in the world of Mormon literature will be felt for generations.

Humans are believed to be essentially divine beings who will ultimately respond in accord with their truest nature. Given this framework, Mormons (like most people) generally prefer their art to reflect this optimism, to reinforce cherished notions and values. Yet in Brian Evenson and Neil LaBute, Mormonism has at least partially given birth to artists who have deliberately chosen to create stories that don't pan out the way they're supposed to, in which heroes don't win out and villains often walk in the world unmolested. Or worse, artists who in many cases refuse to identify any moral framework or make any ethical judgment on the actions of their characters. What are these artists thinking? How can they defend their choices to show unrepentant and unredeemed selfishness, delusion, obsession, violence, and cruelty? In filmmaker Richard Dutcher, one finds another LDS artist whose films, though certainly depicting a brighter ethical universe, often portray Mormon characters with deep flaws who don't always come around, a storyteller willing to shine a light on problems and the ragged edges of too-easy answers. What happens when LDS artists stretch boundaries? Why do they do it? What do we learn about ourselves as individuals and a culture in the ways we react to their work?"

Yoga is the union of body, mind, and spirit within an individual and then the union of the individual with the Divine. This certainly seems consistent with the message and life of Christ. What did Jesus mean when he said, “Take my yoke upon you . . . and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light”? What kind of yoke or yoga can make a burden become light? Although the teachings of Jesus are often presented from a Western perspective, many from Eastern traditions believe Jesus was an advanced yogi.

Oaks challenged teachers in the Church to become more effective, yet there has been no official follow-up in helping teachers enliven their classes. As the lingua franca for much of society today, and especially young people, popular culture is uniquely suited to add interest and immediacy to sometimes esoteric Church teachings.

In this presentation, I trace the complex, dramatic changes that Mormon teachings about the “heavenly family” have undergone since Joseph Smith's days.

Many Saints proudly embrace the official snack food of Utah as a whimsical symbol of our peculiarity. Yet are we any more peculiar than the Lutherans of Minnesota or the Methodists of the South, who are also known for their predilection for Jell-O? Is there really a “Jell-O belt” running from Idaho through Utah and into Arizona?

It is addressed equally to each person and invites everyone to partake of the goodness of God. Priesthood, on the other hand, is associated with special rights and powers, hierarchy, and lineage. And the Church, governed and structured by the priesthood, contains many inequalities.

Mormon fundamentalists and modern polygamists generally assert that plural marriage is a commandment of God, required of all of his worthy followers irrespective of time and place. For this reason, they have attempted to continue polygamy after President Joseph F. Smith stopped approving plural sealings in April 1904.

More than twenty films have emerged since then, some produced to have crossover appeal (e.g., The Other Side of Heaven and Dutcher's films, including his newest, States of Grace), others unabashedly insular, relying on Mormon in-humor and banking on LDS religiosity (e.g., The Singles Ward, The R.M., Day of Defense).

Bengt Washburn has an M.F.A. in painting from Indiana University in Bloomington. He taught art part time at local universities while applying for teaching positions at crappy colleges all over America. Bengt finally gave up on his painting/art teaching career after reading about Congo the Chimp, a prolific painting monkey with “art” in galleries, museums, and private collections all over the globe. After nine years of toil, his bank account and résumé© were inferior to those of a trained monkey. Since switching to comedy, Bengt has performed in comedy clubs and on college campuses all over the United States. In 2001, he won the prestigious San Francisco International Comedy Competition, and just this past year was invited to perform at the very cool Vancouver International Comedy Festival.

What is more dangerous is that it jolted one of Clifton Jolley's children, his eldest daughter, who called him seeking explanation. A father's instinct to defend his daughter against the evils of DNA research seduced Jolley out of his retirement from Mormonism to investigate and explain the pragmatics and polemics of DNA research as a commentary on the heritage of the Lamanite remnant in the Americas. Although Lobdell is suspicious of the Book of Mormon as history, he used to remark on how “nice” Mormons are.

It has been taught and believed by a surprisingly large number of people in LDS society, including general authorities. Although never popular, some varieties of reincarnation have proven more heretical than others, and Church leaders have often given mixed messages on the subject.

Hitchcock never indicated the origin ofthe monologue nor why he wanted it, leaving manyHitchcock experts to speculate (incorrectly) on itsorigins. How are we to explain this and several othersubtle echoes of Mormonism in Hitchcock’s finalmovie? Based on research at the Hitchcockarchives, as well as interviews with the film’sassistant director, sound editor, and PatriciaHitchcock (Alfred’s daughter), this presentationargues that the passages are an important elementin interpreting Hitchcock’s final movie, and thatFamily Plot offers an implicit commentary onMormonism as well."

By selecting active, precise, and livinglanguage, we can force ourselves to question ourassumptions, challenge our faith, and ultimatelyelevate our testimonies. This session explores theencroachment of institutional language into our faithexpressions. It also includes several groupexercises, including experiments with E-prime, aconventional form of English that forbids use of anyconjugated form of the verb “to be.” Let’s see whata little experimenting can accomplish with commontestimony phrases such as, “I know the Church istrue,” if we can’t use the word “is”!"

This presentation explores these connections and suggests ways that Mormons can significantly complement their own practices with those of these other traditions, along with newly developed integral spiritual practices and techniques from Western therapeutic and developmental psychology."

A.: Michael Servetus (Miguel Serveto), the learned Spaniard from Aragon burned alive by the Protestants in 1553. Latter-day-Saints honor Luther,Calvin, Wycliffe, and others as path-pavers for the Restoration, but Serveto really is our man in the Radical Reformation and in Christian history. Come learn more about Servetus. Who is he? Which of his doctrines closely match those of Joseph Smith?"	SL06365	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL06365.mp3																				Reading. Mormon American Princess	Steven Fales	"SL06366, Reading. Mormon American Princess Fresh from his hit Off-Broadway run of Confessions of a Mormon Boy, Steven Fales returns to Sunstone to debut a new solo show full of his outrageous style of humor, monologue, and song. God has seen him through excommunication, divorce, prostitution, and drugs; now Steven's working on narcissism. And it hasn't been going well! When everything one knows about being human comes from Utah, about being American comes from Las Vegas (where Steven was raised), and about being gay comes from the penthouses of Manhattan, BE VERY AFRAID. In Mormon American Princess, Steven has finally come to believe he is powerless over his addiction to himself.

Initially written by Brigham Young University professor Eric Samuelsen as a play, the film version has emerged as a true cooperative venture by the writer, director, crew, and cast, who have all worked on the film for free. Of Peculiarities’s origins, Samuelsen says: Ever since I began teaching at BYU in 1992, I’ve become a bemused student of Mormon culture, intrigued by its idiosyncrasies and oddities and inconsistencies. Every so often, my observations have resulted in plays: Gadianton, The Way We’re Wired, Without Romance, and others. peculiarities is the result of conversations I’ve had with the LDS young people I teach and interact with. Mormon culture tends to preach a “letter of the law” approach to moral questions, and especially in regards to issues of sexual morality. And so I became aware of some of the peculiar ways in which moral rigidity and sexuality collide in our culture. It occurred to me that combining all these stories and practices into a single play might make for a compelling evening in the theatre. I was especially taken with the idea of presenting this material naturalistically, simply showing the stories of these flawed human characters without apology, explanation, or mediation, presuming a morally centered audience and allowing that audience the space to reach their own conclusions about theissues raised by these stories. And so, sometime around 1999, I wrote Peculiarities. The film features six separate stories, exploring difficult topics not to glorify poor decisions nor to make fun of the moral attitudes and inconsistencies that lead the characters to make those decisions, but to illustrate and better understand their consequences. Noted LDS storyteller Orson Scott Card says, “Mormons can no more live by empty, meaningless art that pretends to be moral because it is devoid of any relation to reality than the rest of the world can live by art that scoffs at morality and presents a view of life as a meaningless, pointless, undirected accident.” Peculiarities strives to be moral art that is at the same time effective as art."

We've managed brief glimpses into his intellectual and spiritual life through various panelist and respondent stints, including his 1996 “Pillars of My Faith” address. We got a sense of the wide variety of his passions and interests in the short “Sunstone Gallery” feature in the January 2002 Sunstone. But what do we really know about Ardean Watts? Friends, it's time for the full load! Join us for a delightful tour of a colorful, musical, and extraordinarily joyful life. After proper cajoling, this maestro has graciously agreed to take up the baton (we mean remote control) and conduct us on a pictoral, personally narrated and properly soundtracked trip through events and people, ideas and loves that animate this most animated of lives. Ardean will lead us through everything from beginnings and mission to Utah symphony, opera, and arts, environmental, and peace activism; from university teaching to church service and his own form of “course correction”; from family and friends to birding and mushrooms, including travels on four continents. And, as anyone who knows Ardean might expect, the touch will be light and the emphasis, irreverent! There can be no better way to close your experience at this symposium exploring Mormonism and artistic culture than joining with the Sunstone community in celebrating our great friend Ardean and the series of fortunate events that have shaped this wonderful, vibrant soul."

This article argues that faithful Latter-day Saints may appropriately harmonize the biblical account of the Flood with the massive scientific evidence against an inundation of global dimensions by reinterpreting the biblical account as applying to a regional flood.

It declares that same-sex attractions are not considered sinful but affirms that acting on those attractions is incompatible with God’s plan for families in the afterlife.

I am drawn to radical spiritual commitments, and so naturally, Latter-day Saints interest me. For me, making documentaries is an elaborate creative and spiritual project, one of balancing and layering, of crawling inside the revelation of another religion. I will outline the complicated process of making The Mormons and illustrate it with behind-thescenes stories and guiding strategies that will, I hope, help us better understand the never-ending dance Mormonism has with the media, and vice versa. I will detail my preparation process, including the challenge of persuading PBS to commission a documentary on Mormons, and the overwhelming tasks of understanding Mormonism, of gaining access, reading stacks of books and articles, interviewing hundreds of experts and lay folk, many of whom first had to get permission to talk to me. For The Mormons, I wanted to create a thematic work, not a chronological history. Our challenge was to determine what are the defining events, ideas of Mormonism? How can we describe some, but not all, of Mormonism's big bold ideas without getting lost in a theology lesson? How might we tell some, but not all, of the history and not get lost in a chronological swamp of names and events? How might we establish balance when examining the truth claims of Mormonism without either endorsing/selling the religion or subjecting it to inappropriate attack? We interviewed some 1,000 people before we began filming. Our primary challenge then was to find the right personal mini-dramas and especially people who speak without deadening piety or platitudes. Then there was the search for images! How might we visually suggest the shockingly literal nature of Mormonism but not allow the film's metaphors to be taken literally? Finally, I will speak about the response of non-Mormons to the documentary and what these reactions tell us about the relationship between Mormons and mainstream America. I will also share what surprised me most in making this documentary, personally and professionally."

MORMONISM AS A MAJOR ISSUE IN THE 2008 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN The presidential campaign of Mitt Romney has generated significant attention to his beliefs and practices as an active Mormon. A great deal of media attention has focused on the central question: Is the United States ready to elect a Mormon President? In exploring this question, I will draw comparisons with George Romney's 1968 campaign for president, who, like his son Mitt, was a devout Latter-day Saint. Why does Mormonism appear to be a more controversial issue vis a vis Mitt Romney's pursuit of the White House than it was forty years ago when his father sought the same office?"

Is this silence inspired by jealousy over the fact that the Community of Christ owns the grave, or does it arise from deeper motivations? In this illustrated essay, I follow the tortuous history of Joseph Smith's bones, secret burials, exhumations, family feuds, and even the speculation that Smith has already been resurrected.

The need to continue a religious dialogue with the LDS church requires the knowledge of the Church's juridical structure of marriage in its similarities and differences with the Roman Catholic Church.

One might watch this film and see Kane as being redeemed by his conversion, as given meaning by his job at the family history center, and as rewarded by the reunion of the New York Dolls at the Morrissey Meltdown festival. This is too simplistic. Kane's nostalgia for his former life as a raunchy rock star is apparent from the opening of the film and not indicative of a simple LDS conversion story. Kane's bishop's advice about reconciling with his former bandmates and his ward members' help to retrieve his pawned guitars bring together two worlds usually rent apart.

In the course of constructing their religion, Mormons began to see themselves as special descendants meant to congregate together on chosen land, and they believed that they shared a common bloodline heretofore unknown to them.

When most people read Ephesians 5:23, “For the husband is the head of his wife the way Christ is the head of the Church,” they cannot help but understand “head” to mean “ruler,” “leader,” or some other form of “authority over.” And since Latter-day Saints believe the Bible to be the “word of God, as far as it is translated correctly,” that means the husband's the boss, right? In fact, “authority over” is not a correct translation of kephale (head). I will show that instead of mandating hierarchy in marriage, Paul actually is instructing husbands to behave in such a way that they grow in unity and love with their wives.

Both ideologies look forward to the abolition of government and the building of a socialist society based on free association and cooperation. Attempting to argue such a case seems perplexing, given the generally pro-capitalist, pro-government, pro-war stance of many American Mormons. Such attitudes exist despite resources within Mormon scripture advocating the contrary, and sadly lead to Mormon support for militarism, imperialism, and economic and other kinds of exploitation.

The vision of the KEP, consistent with contemporary Mormon theology, unites celestial, priestly, and family hierarchies to connect time, space, and human creation in Smith's stunning and comprehensive view of the afterlife."

This new approach was quickly adopted by several other Mormon senators and was even mistaken by non-Mormons as official LDS doctrine.

Men and women have different roles and responsibilities within the church but equal responsibility to gain the skills and knowledge necessary for full participation in public church life.

This situation has led many Latter-day Saints to interpret Book of Mormon Trinitarian language in light of current doctrine—a project that yields unsatisfying results. A key to interpreting the Book of Mormon’s theologyof God is in Ethan Smith’s A Treatise on the Character of Jesus Christ, and on the Trinity in Unity of the Godhead (1814). The treatise offers fascinating insights for those of us who have never found explanations of the Book of Mormon’s views on the Godhead to make much sense."

Polls revealing in some cases that a third or more potential voters would have strong hesitations in voting for a Mormon candidate have caught many Latter-day Saints off guard. Is Mormonism still such a lightning rod, still so associated with the claims of cultishness, still so misunderstood in terms of its current versus past practices and teachings so as to elicit this kind of a priori rejection of a candidate simply because of his faith tradition? This panel of careful and astute Mormon-watchers from backgrounds in different fields and from both without and within the LDS church wrestles with Mormonism's present and speculates about its future courtesy of this “Mitt moment.” How will his Mormon faith affect his run for the Republican nomination? And how might those dynamics shift were he to receive that nod and run in the general election? And what might the dynamics be should he become President? Conversely, what effects will his officeseeking and very public profile have upon Mormonism? What will come as LDS doctrines past and present are lifted up for examination in the public arena?

Media outlets from the Salt Lake Tribune to the New York Times regularly rely on LDS bloggers for Mormon perspectives. In some ways, the bloggernacle hasbecome one of the more visible faces ofMormonism. But just how accurately does the bloggernacle represent Mormons and Mormonism? Are there demographic or ideological biases in the bloggernacle? Are certain groups excluded, women, or gays, or even conservatives?

EMBODIMENT AND THE KING FOLLETT DISCOURSE The LDS doctrine of deity differs radically from the traditional Christian concept of the Trinity, and this difference is a major point of contention between Mormons and other Christians. But LDS scriptures themselves present many points of conflict with the Church's official doctrine of deity, which gives priority to the Pearl of Great Price account of the First Vision and the King Follett Discourse.

Using Borg'smodel, I suggest that what is happening in the Episcopal Church is also occurring in the LDS church, though quieter and with less drama. The “schism” is between those who are certain the LDS Church has God's final word and those who are less certain but still find a spiritual edification within the psychological and sociological framework of the institution."

Many proposals call for some combination of investigation, apology, and monetary compensation to slave descendants. As a Mormon and a reparations advocate, I'm in a no-man's-land. Colleagues who support reparations have negative views of the Church, and Church friends are skeptical of the idea of reparations. Both sides can learn from each other. For example, reparations scholarship can draw on the history of Mormon claims for redress. Similarly, there are many reasons, based on Mormon doctrine, culture, and history, why Latter-day Saints should support slavery reparations. In this 150th anniversary year of the Mountain Meadows Massacre, we need to think seriously about concepts such as group harm, restitution, atonement, and reconciliation. Slavery reparations provides a good lens for this examination."

ROBERT BECKSTEAD	"SL07255, THE RESTORATION AND THE SACRED MUSHROOM: DID JOSEPH SMITH USE PSYCHEDELICS TO FACILITATE HIS VISIONARY EXPERIENCES? Gnosticism and shamanism practice techniques of “knowing”, entering spiritual dimensions and experiencing the ineffable, both heavenly and hellish. Derivative forms of these ancient traditions were practiced in upstate New York during Joseph Smith's formative years. Interestingly, shamans and Gnostics used certain psychotropic plants and fungi during rituals and ceremonies to facilitate trance states. Used in this setting, psychoactive substances are often called “entheogen,” meaning to manifest “God within.” I will review the use of entheogens in shamanic and Gnostic traditions and the evidence that puts Joseph Smith in proximity to their use. It will also show how the use of entheogens can reproduce many of the paranormal and mythmaking abilities Joseph manifested."

(1) The Joseph Campbell story structure always starts with a hero who must find an “elixir” to heal either an ailing community or him/herself, an elixir that can be found only outside the community, both spatially and ideologically. Claiming to be the only true church and unable to apostatize, the LDS church often sees such journeys as a threat. (2) These stories skip from a first act (the set-up) to a third act (the resolution), leaving out the second act: struggle. By leaving out this second act, institutionally told stories suggest there is no need to wrestle with angels or argue with God because the proper resolution of our struggles has been determined. We argue that we should embrace the challenge to “work out our own salvation” as an invitation to play God's fools."

I look at the status of spiritual experience as the ground of commitment for one's life, its epistemic status and its spiritual significance. I argue that attacks claiming that such experiences are not trustworthy because they are merely ephemeral emotions are based on a caricature and unjustified reduction. In the hands of evangelicals, these critiques are self-refuting, incoherent, and contrary to scripture. The same attack from a secular perspective is also unjustifiably reductive and selfdefeating, but for different reasons. Religious experiences entail both cognitive and affective dimensions that, when synergistically joined, are a sound basis of commitment.There is a peculiar genius and beauty in religious commitment that is won by God one heart at a time."

The title of this panel discussion comes from a website discussed by atheist Sam Harris in his book, Letter to A Christian Nation, that insists that there are no “answered” prayers that could not be written off as coincidence. Despite all of the healings from sickness or close calls averted, he says, God never, ever, heals an amputee, no matter how many people are praying it (and despite biblical promises that whatever is asked in faith can be received). Harris's book (as well as his lengthier The End of Faith), and Richard Dawkins's, The God Delusion, have become extremely popular, arguing intelligently from the position of science, human suffering, and biblical problems that there is almost certainly no supreme being or personal deity. Aside from the conviction of personal testimony, can science and reason be usedjust as convincingly for the existence of God? How might believers respond just as intelligently to the newly popular atheist movement? Are there aspects of these discussions that Latter-day Saints, in particular, might contribute to?"

Rather than denouncing war and proclaiming peace as God calls us to do (D&C 98:16), Mormon politicians, leaders, and lay members have been quick to endorse and slow to criticize the administration's incursion into the Valley of the Euphrates. This panel explores the reasons why, even with a recent decline in support among Utah Mormons, support for the war in Iraq is still significantly above the national average. It also makes serious recommendations as to how Mormons could help end the war."

Nelson, the LDS church's point person for the Defense of Marriage Amendment, remarried in the temple in 2006, four days after defining marriage as “the union between one man and one woman,” activists balked, creating a website, EMOVENELSON.NET, and dubbing him a “celestial polygamist.” While the LDS church publicly announced its abandonment of the practice of polygamy in the late 19th century and has since distanced itself from it, celestial polygamy persists in mainstream Mormon doctrine and temple sealing practices. This panel explores the contemporary LDS concept and practice of celestial polygamy, how it affects couples, families, and women, particularly in cases of divorce, and its persistence despite recent statements by Church leaders and their preoccupation with institutional image."

The stigma of shame has often led many LGBT members to experience their sexuality in shadow, cheating on spouses, meeting on the “down-low,” and drug abuse. However, years of hard-fought activism have effectively reduced the stigma of homosexuality in our culture. The result is a new generation of selfactualized, productive queer men and women. This panel will feature men and women with a Mormon upbringing who have thoughtfully embraced authentic gay lives. The panel will also address the recent Church pamphlet, God Loveth His Children, and suggest how embracing a queer-positive sexuality can empower those struggling with depression, anxiety, and conflict with both faith and family."

JODY ENGLUND	"SL07301, IT'S NOW OR NEVER: HOW MUCH LONGER DO I HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE PLANETS TO ALIGN? Okay, here is another “there are two types of people in the world” observation: There are those who are waiting for life to happen, and there are those who make life happen. In LDS culture, I hear people say “If it's God's will, it will happen” or “God will let me know if I need to do anything.” Then they are frustrated when their life isn't what they think it should be. I wonder when this amazing gift of personal revelation and inspiration became an excuse for not being active in one's life? I think God wants us to be practicing the qualities of Godhood now, the greatest of these being the power to create extraordinary life, beginning with our own. Maybe we can cause the planets to align."

I will specifically look at the Main Street Plaza Controversy, the 2002 Winter Olympics, and most recently, statements in response to inquiries about presidential hopeful Mitt Romney's campaign.

However, important questions remain unexplored in our attempt to better understand people of different faiths and ideological perspectives. The fact that only a small percentage of the human family has heard the gospel challenges us to think more carefully about the scope of the gospel and the place of religious diversity within it.

The Quetzalcoatl mythology is very complex and has undergone multiple transformations in the hands of those who have heard it and repeated it, a process that began with the early Spanish recorders of the myth and has its most recent elaboration in the Quetzalcoatl/Christ stories.

Many authors and historians have accepted this alleged scenario without consideration of the substantial and persuasive evidence that this is an extreme distortion. In the last few years, several hundred thousand books have been sold asserting that the Mountain Meadows Massacre was an act of vengeance in fulfillment of an oath sworn to by all participants in the endowment ceremony.

Traditionally overshadowed by male surname-conferring bloodlines, our matrilineal pedigree remains a vital influence on identity. This essay, an introduction to a work of creative nonfiction, examines how my own engagement with five hundred years and twelve generations of Germanic foremothers connects me to my genetic past, and to twelve long-lived North Friesian women, in ways likely to elude a genealogist focused on baptizing deceased relations. “Matrilineal genealogy” pays tribute to the women, named at the bottom of our pedigree charts, who publish their history in our genes."

The first part of the Sermon on the Mount must have been controversial at the time, when every action seemed to be guided by law and one's position meant everything. Christ promises blessings and happiness to people that have nothing to do with what they have nor their circumstances. Are the Beatitudes more acceptable now? It seems that they have become more of a nice quotable bit of scripture than the startling message that came from Christ's mouth. Are we more concerned with what we have and do than with who we are?

I examine evidence showing that, contrary to Smith's practice and shortly after his murder, LDS women were denied continued participation in the highest quorum of the church, were no longer anointed priestesses unto God, and were deprived of the Relief Society as a female priesthood organization. I explore how these blows to women's claim to priesthood theologically resulted in the vitiation of the doctrine of the fullness of the priesthood as the basis for the Quorum of the Twelve's claim to succeed Joseph Smith as successor, as well as the negative impact that the denial of priesthood fulness to women has had on the LDS church and the male priesthood contingent."

Since the first publication of the Book of Mormon, Mormons have covenanted with American Indians and Polynesians that they are the Lamanites. Recently, however, many Book of Mormon apologists have been cowed by evidence that American Indians are not trans-oceanic Israelites but descendants of Asiatic peoples, and as a result,have begun to retreat from traditional claims. But the Book of Mormon remnant are not so quick to surrender their birthright. Tribes such as the Havasupai have declined to participate in the National Geographic DNA definition of their history and religion. If Mormons are able to deny our paternalistic policies rather than betray our promises, if we can receive the example of indigenous peoples' loyal to their myths rather than vainly attempting to reconcile our historical faith with contemporary science, we may yet discover a better response to genome research by being carried in the arms and upon the shoulders of the Lamanites."

Perhaps fewer members would feel “betrayed” by the Church when they encounter troubling information after being in the Church for years without being taught about discrepencies.

As they adapt the old and integrate the new, they create new spiritual possibilities for themselves and ultimately for those who stand beside them and come after them. In the tradition of past Sunstone panels on human potential and women's spirituality, this panel explores the spiritual journey of Latter-day Saint women who embark on alternate paths through practices such as dreamwork, channeling, and earth-based ritual, and who maintain (though not without struggle) intimate relationships while engaging in extra-Mormon spiritual practices."

W. GRANT MCMURRAY	"SL07391, Banquet- JOSEPH SMITH MEETS MITT ROMNEY: WHAT DOES THE MORMON PAST CONTRIBUTE TO THE CRAFTING OF A CREDIBLE GLOBAL VISION FOR THE 21ST CENTURY? Grant McMurray, former president of the Community of Christ, will reflect on the opportunities and challenges resulting from a Mormon candidacy for president of the United States. With the world now watching how the movement defines itself, he argues that the sectarian interpretations of Restorationorthodoxy areoften inadequate, and even worse, silly. If there is a contemporary contribution to be offered by the Restoration movement, it cannot rest on ludicrous claims to “all truth” or prophetic inerrancy. But the Romney campaign does unwittingly provide an opportunity to sift through the church's heritage in search of values and understandings that are credible in the broader culture of American society. What one finds, if looking through new eyes, is surprisingly visionary and thereby a worthy contributor to the dialogue so desperately needed in a world searching for community and yearning for peace."

Walker Lewis and Thomas Coleman: Two Black Mormons Confront Utah's Early Theocracy This paper examines the lives of two early black Mormons who came to ""Deseret"" in the early 1850s. Walker Lewis was a wealthy radical abolitionist and powerful Freemason from Boston who had been ordained an Elder by Apostle William Smith in the summer of 1843. Thomas Coleman was brought to Utah as a slave by Col. J. H. Johnson and eventually baptized a Mormon. The two men, both with strong ties to Brigham Young, had very different yet negative experiences while in the budding theocracy, mainly due to their different social classes: Lewis was completely shunned by former friends and high-ranking Church officials whom he had previously fed, sheltered, and supported, causing him to leave Utah and the Church. Coleman was brutally murdered in 1866 in what appears to have been a racially motivated blood atonement ritual on Capitol Hill but may have been a cover up to protect """"higher interests."""""

This situation has led many Latter-day Saints to interpret Book of Mormon understandings in light of current doctrine—a project that yields unsatisfying results. In December 2006, in an Irish rare book shop, I found a key to interpreting the Book of Mormon’s theology of God in Ethan Smith’s A Treatise on the Character of Jesus Christ, and on the Trinity in Unity of the Godhead (1814). The treatise offers fascinating insights for those of us who have devoted years of study to Joseph Smith’s narrative but have never found explanations for its views on the Godhead to make much sense."

Critics of the Book of Mormon argue that it is unrealistic to believe that following four centuries of internecine conflict and violent struggle, peoples as warlike as the Nephites and Lamanites could have had two centuries of peace. The Book of Mormon itself provides the most convincing evidence that such peace is attainable. This paper examines the conditions that led up to that long season of peace and explores the reasons why so many generations refused to go to war. Finally, it attempts to draw parallels between Nephite history before, during, and after the coming of Christ to the New World and what is currently happening in the Valley of the Euphrates and how, at the beginning of the 21st century, we can begin shaping the peace that seems so essential."

The event, often referred to as “that day in June,” placed a spotlight on local Mormon leadership as it responded to the death and destruction wrought by the floodwaters. From door-to-door evacuation efforts to busloads of out-of-state cleanup crews, the actions of Latter-day Saints played a crucial role in how the drama unfolded.

Fowler in his classic study, The Stages of Faith, has helped many people from a wide variety of religious traditions better understand their own faith journey. It has been embraced especially by many who feel they have ""lost"" their faith or recognize that they are in some way transitioning into new ways of understanding God and the universe or are struggling with changing relationships with their tradition's sacred texts, teachings, and broader religious community. The presenters in this session are familiar with the work of Fowler and other stage theorists and will discuss Mormon-specific applications of this approach to understanding faith.

In many ways, Mitt Romney is a dream candidate for Mormons: he is handsome, bright, charismatic, and articulate. He has been a successful businessman and politician as well as Church leader. He has a quintessential Mormon pedigree, polygamous ancestors; distinguished genealogy; son of a prominent political, business, and Church leader; ideal family man. In many ways, he seems like a general authority. And yet, a number of Mormons are disquieted by what they see as Romney's reshaping himself from a moderate to a far right conservative, one more at home with the extreme edge of the Republican Party and Fundamentalist Christian Coalition than with the American Mainstream. How do Mormons with ambiguous or even negative feelings about Romney deal with their loyalty to the Church and the prospect of having a fellow Mormon in the White House?

Given that science and technology are among the most obvious manifestations of active faith in the future (fighting disease, improving communications, cleaning environments, extending life spans), how might we promote the application of science and technology to a Mormon view of the future and bring them into dialogue with the plan of salvation?

This high-profile film covers everything from Church origins, scripture, persecution, exodus, and nineteenth-century controversies to today's mainstreaming and emphases on families, missions, patriotism, and image, and how those play out in the lives of contemporary Latter-day Saints, both those who fit within the ideal and those who don't.

Originally, however, these were denigrations used to describe the unsophisticated country dwellers who had not yet accepted the tenets of Christianity then normative among city dwellers. This paper will suggest that 'paganism' in this sense of the term should now apply to the scriptural literalism that is still existent today and which is decidedly more common among people who dwell in rural or other less-densely-populated areas.

We all belong to a generation, whether conscious of it or not. Generations are age-based cohorts who share somewhat similar life experiences: They have grown up influenced by common national and international events; their outlook and values were shaped in their formative years by the social environments of which they were and still are a part. Religiously, there is an important impact, and often subtle. Broad social and cultural changes, especially in the role of the media and shifts in work and family patterns, all bear upon how we see ourselves and our understandings of faith, spirituality, God, and social issues important to us. In this presentation, we shall look at four generations-World War II Generation, Baby Boomers, Generation Xers, and Millennials -and profile their differing religious and spiritual views, the challenges each has or has had in making sense of their lives, and their lived expressions of faith. As we shall see, the fundamental question 'Who Am I?' turns out to be far more complex that we might have first imagined."

Rees	"SL08111, Mormons and the Cross The cross, perhaps the most potent and ubiquitous symbol in Christendom, has been essentially rejected as a symbol by the LDS Church. Mormons do not wear crosses, and no Mormon chapel or temple is adorned with a cross. For other Christians, who see the cross as the very emblem of Christ's mission and gospel, this is a scandal and one of the reasons they consider Mormons non-Christian. This session examines the cross in Mormon scripture and history, explores the reasons for the Mormon rejection of the symbolic cross, and considers the implications of this rejection for the Church, especially in light of its wish to be considered a Christian church and to find greater common cause with other Christians."

The world of the teller and what she tells overlap, simultaneously exist, and react upon and against each other. Theoretical frameworks developed by narratologists and anthropologists help us explore the meaning and potency of ritual in shaping our reality. Rituals, like storytelling, are also performances in space and time that evoke other worlds. When we believingly participate in rituals, the world of the sacred is invited to exist and act upon our real life. We press against the dark glass and peek behind the veil that separates the story from the storytelling and the ritual from the real."

We each possess equal privilege to speak and share equal and reciprocal obligation to listen. This peer principle can lead to meaningful dialogue, deliberation, and ultimately to a place of mutual trust. Then, even if consensus cannot be achieved, deliberation can show us a way forward based on the discovery of common ground and the respect we have for one another. How might we Latter-day Saints do better in encouraging more openness and honesty when we engage each other? And without this type of communication, can we really gain genuine intellectual, emotional, and spiritual convictions about gospel truths?"

Jolly	"SL08115, Mormon Heaven: Everything the Prophets Didn't Tell You Joseph Smith said that if we knew how great heaven is going to be, we'd kill ourselves to get there. Then he cautiously told us almost nothing about it. Later prophets have been even less help, unwilling to venture even so far as an opinion of whether there is progression between the kingdoms. So, although Mormons know more about heaven than do other Christians, it's not much more than what is postulated by Islam, and not enough better to encourage suicide. Dr. Jolley's tautology fills in the gaps, creating aversion of heaven inspired by Mark Twain, Pogo, and (perhaps least of all) the prophets."

But a century of scholarship has identified language errors and anachronisms inconsistent with a supernaturally perfect translation. Who is right-the witnesses or the scholars? Or are they all wrong together? Can the reported visual translation method be squared with the actual contents of the book? And if Joseph Smith merely read the text through his stone, did he 'translate' at all? If not, who was the translator of the Book of Mormon, and what are the implications of that answer for us?"

In March 2008, Catholics of San Luis, Colorado, were outraged when they found photos online that depicted LDS missionaries vandalizing-and allegedly desecrating- their shrine. Forgiven, but not forgotten, the act evokes a 1972 public relations debacle when two LDS missionaries served six months in a Thai prison after posing atop a Buddha.

"Tristan Call, Ashley Sanders, Caleb Proux"	"SL08135, Does the BYU 'Honor Code' Honor Mormon Values? BYU is the production house of next-generation Mormonism. Perhaps feeling the pressure of this expectation, the university places great emphasis on the standards and principles that distinguish it from other universities. The Honor Code is often cited as a document that safeguards the values of both the university and of Mormonism, but for many students, it does the opposite: it restricts or reverses their quest for authentic spirituality while punishing dissent and exploration. This panel will examine the history of the BYU Honor Code and the ways that it constructs and deconstructs mainstream Mormonism. Drawing on research about activism and dissent at BYU, the panelists will offer a critique of the Honor Code through the perspectives of students whose spiritual quest put them at odds with their religion."

Immersed in media, they employ social networks on a scale never before seen. They are more connected and technically sophisticated than any previous generation-a fact that is changing social dynamics and the meaning of community. Rather than passively consuming, this generation expects to create, contribute, and critique. Institutions can no longer fully control the flow of information, and attempting to do so can be disastrous. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the gospel it represents are not immune to these changing dynamics.

More than a hundred and fifty years of growth, change, and re-examination has occurred since then, leading to a new message, a new mission, and a new identity: the Community of Christ. This brief introduction to the Community of Christ will focus on the basic tenets of faith and identity that characterize the current movement and highlight some of the diversity of ideas that are represented in the global church. Topics will include modern-day concepts of Zion, the centrality of Christ, the challenge of becoming a peace church, an outline of leaders and structure, and hearing the voice of the people.

A Freudian Approach to The Sugar Beet	"Mathew N. Schmalz, Christopher Bigelow"	"SL08153, Is a Rameumptom Just a Rameumptom? A Freudian Approach to The Sugar Beet Latter-day Saints are conventionally and stereotypically portrayed as inhabiting a G-rated culture that valorizes domesticity, obedience, and chastity. For this reason, and the fact that many Mormons enthusiastically embrace the stereotypes, the humor of The Sugar Beet is particularly interesting. In its treatment of issues concerning sexuality, gender, and authority, The Sugar Beet has opened or at least laid bare, another level of Mormon culture that is much more complex than that assumed in the stereotypes. But what makes Mormon humor, humorous? To explore this question, I turn to the work of Sigmund Freud who argues that jokes have two primary functions: aggression and exposure. In analyzing several jokes from The Sugar Beet, I will probe whether Freud's framework helps us to understand the underlying dynamics of Mormon humor. The presentation will be interactive, with audience members being invited at times to reflect upon what is (and is not) humorous about a particular joke."

Yale Professor Harold Bloom, celebrated author of the book The American Religion and ardent advocate of Joseph Smith's primary place in American history, asks a critical question at the end of his provocative Sunstone essay, 'Perspectivism and Joseph Smith' (Sunstone, March 2007). In echoing Fawn Brodie's classic biography No Man Knows My History, Bloom confesses 'I believe Joseph when he says we don't know him; to me, it is the most important statement of his life.' He ends his essay with the title question: 'Did he know himself?' Since the good professor is not now available to us (we tried!), I propose to discuss his question with an emphasis on how the rising generation might respond to it. How do our youth answer such a question, not only about Brother Joseph, but about themselves? For that matter, how do the rest of us answer for ourselves?"

Yet among a small group of recovering drug addicts, the theology of Mormonism was reinvented and reinvigorated to encompass their specialized struggles. The Group started as an informal organization, partially the brainchild of Gerald and Carol Lynn Pearson, but was soon so successful that it was incorporated into local Church structure. Examining the stories, both of success and failure, within the Group is both enlightening and heartbreaking, not just for the sake of humanism but in order to observe how each generation reinvents Mormonism for its times."

Elder Holland affirmed LDS people believe Father, Son, and Holy Ghost 'are one in every significant and eternal aspect imaginable except believing Them to be three persons combined in one substance.'

College students in particular often experience intense conflict when they encounter challenges to official church narratives. How do members deal with such conflict? Carl Jung developed a model for the growth of the psyche that he named 'individuation.' Jung asserts that the unconscious leads us to health and growth. Sometimes this is accomplished through dreams, whether we pay attention to them or not. Of course, if we attend to our dreams, we may understand signals the unconscious gives us regarding our relationship to authority systems. I present examples of dreams analyzed through Eugene Kovalenko's CREEI process. Dream analysis can be a viable method of coping with religious conflict. Part 2-Led by Eugene Kovalenko, and using the CREEI process, session attendees will have the opportunity to analyze a dream or a personal experience."

"John Hamer, Mark Scherer, Morris Thurston, Stephen Taysom, John-Charles Duffy"	"SL08172, A New Faithful History That Is Faithful to History? Over the past century, as more Mormons have acquired professional training, they have applied their skills to Mormonism's foundational narratives. This experience has left our understanding of Mormon history much enriched, but it has inevitably led to the revision (and even unraveling) of many traditional stories. It has also led to a division into two broad groups: critics and apologists. This panel will consider how Mormon historians can move beyond the critic/apologist dichotomy in order to produce faithful history that is faithful to history. How can historians begin to craft a new historical narrative that is honest and open and yet still positive and useful for average believers?"

In a press conference, new Young Women president Elaine Dalton was asked about statistics indicating 80 percent of single Mormon women ages 18 to 30 are not active in the LDS Church. The reaction to Beck's talk and the inactivity of single women may be connected to changing perceptions of motherhood. To what extent is the role of mother prescribed and scripted for Mormon women?

Certainty discourages inquiry. Literalism creates an atmosphere of skeptical rejection of many figurative, symbolic, or metaphorically rich possibilities-and this, in turn can lead to mistaken application of scriptural texts. Unwavering obedience to leaders (including the notion that even if leaders make mistakes, we are blessed by obeying them anyway) tends to foster an unhealthy culture of hero worship and a view of General Authorities as celebrities, resulting in our being distracted from the central figure of the Savior and sometimes promoting a mentality that leads to abuses of power."

Why Christ Must Be the Prism through Which All War Scripture and Theology is Interpreted The two presenters are currently working on a book discussing a Christ-centric approach towards issues of war and peace in scripture and LDS theology. Throughout our tradition's existence, Latter-day Saints have selectively drawn upon war narratives from both the Bible and our own additional scripture to support and validate everything from imperial conquests, pre-emptive wars of 'self defense,' and even genocide. Contrary to the view among many that the scriptures are paradoxical and inconsistent, and therefore adaptable to essentially all U.S. declarations of war, we believe that a more critical and comprehensive reading of latter-day scripture reveals a clear, powerful, and consistent framework wherein we are invited to 'renounce war[s] and proclaim peace' (D&C 98:16). In particular, scriptural narratives about war and peace are quite clear if Christ's teachings, life, and death are allowed to serve as the prism through which they are interpreted, understood, and followed."

Fear to speak up; fear that I'm not good enough; fear of failure; fear of being honest; fear of non-acceptance; fear of identifying and facing my fears; and fear of my shadow side. These were vague discomforting underlying fears until I saw them magnified in my performance of music. Then I became determined to overcome my fears and shadowy habits. As I have worked on the musical issues, I have become more confident in other areas of my life and have learned to speak up and say what I honestly think, no longer hiding. My music has become deeper, more expressive, and infinitely more satisfying. Integrating our shadow with our light brings about spiritual growth and a joyous discovery of self.

The Mormon Doctrine of Human Deification Expounded by Joseph Smith and famously summarized by Lorenzo Snow, the LDS doctrine of human deification has, since the 1840s, presented several soteriological and cosmological difficulties. Openly celebrated, elaborated, and contested by generations of Mormon thinkers, the doctrine has today become nearly invisible in official Church discourse. Even LDS apologists defending the doctrine have attempted to tame the bolder implications championed by earlier Mormon thinkers, including Joseph Smith.

Christian conversion requires, many claim, destruction of the ego so the soul is open to grace, arguably a traumatic experience, however redemptive its ultimate effects. Narratives recounting the trauma of conversion (or deconversion) can replicate the trauma, first through writing about it, then through reading about it.

One of the primary roles of religion is to address moral issues and ameliorate social problems. But in a politically and economically globalized world, religion must revisit what counts as moral and expand the scope of its obligations to address contemporary problems. In many ways, Mormonism has restricted its moral canon to include traditional values while dismissing contemporary moral issues as 'political.' In this panel, young Mormons will present a case for five moral issues frequently politicized by the contemporary Church-war, torture, environmentalism, capitalism, and dissent-arguing for their inclusion in the moral canon and discussing ways in which leaders can inspire positive change in the membership."

Thomas"	"SL08235, Forty Days and Forty Nights: The Growing Role of Religions in the Urgent Fight for Environmental Sustainability One Nobel prize-winning biologist from Stanford recently articulated the consensus of hope among biologists: to limit the extinction of species on earth to only 30 percent during this century. This is just one item indicating the enormous environmental challenge before us and the urgent need for environmental sustainability. This panel of leaders from various faith communities will discuss how faith communities can and are leading the way, and what we can do to support sustainability and stewardship of the planet. Among the things to be discussed are the recent Sierra Club award for the large LDS City Creek development in downtown Salt Lake City and Utah Interfaith Power and Light's recent music composition and Earth Day sermon awards for 2008. An original music composition submitted for this contest will be performed during the session."

Jeff Burton, Matt Thurston"	"SL08251, Stories from the Borderlands Many of us at this symposium are in the LDS 'Borderlands' in one way or another, and we've all had interesting, funny, or troubling experiences. We've also overcome difficulties and challenges (or we wouldn't be here!). I will share a few reflections and experiences on Borderlander topics, but I mainly want to hear from audience members about their life in the Borderlands. I want this session to be honest and hopeful, serious but not morbid, fun and enjoyable, adhering to Sunstone's policies of good taste and the avoidance of blame and recrimination. This session is designed to help us learn better how to be successful LDS Borderlanders"	SL08251	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL08251.mp3																				Mormon Nudists: Naked and Not Ashamed	"D. Michael Martindale, David Pace"	"SL08252, Mormon Nudists: Naked and Not Ashamed With extreme policies on wearing temple garments and dressing modestly, the LDS Church seems an unlikely spawning ground for a subculture of nudists. Yet they exist, and in greater numbers than most people probably realize. D. Michael Martindale, a prominent activist for naturism, will present the rationale, spirituality, and poignant stories of members of the Church who believe in being socially nude with one another despite living every day in an environment that condemns such a practice."

In this session, I will heuristically explore an interesting commonality within this culture-homebirth and celestial feminine/magickal practices. I will show the synchronicities between the spiritual heritage of Mormonism (which can be seen in history as well as in current practices) and Mormon women's tendency to birth at home. Using both intuitive inquiry and reflective listening, I present research on my topic of inquiry alongside my inner reflections. Using methods in addition to research, I hope to draw the reader into an interactive experience and integral inquiry tocreate meaning in the human life cycle, as well as artful expression."

Specifically, we will explore how LDS beliefs about the nature of life and afterlife play in both philosophical and theoretical realms and in real-world application."

A challenge for the rising generation will be to prepare themselves to integrate this knowledge and information in ways that give meaning to their lives and in ways that animate their spirituality. This presentation focuses on preparing our minds to be more receptive and to be more capable of comprehending that which the Lord would have us understand. We'll examine how Ken Wilber's 'Integral Spirituality' complements Latter-day doctrine and both ancient and modern scripture."

Is the Mormon understanding of God and the universe something I can continue to embrace? Is it possible to keep my intellectual integrity and still be a deeply committed Mormon? What would happen if I abandoned my faith? A crisis of faith experience stretches one's emotional, spiritual, and intellectual resources to the limit. This presentation explores research conducted at Harvard University that tells the stories of six highly educated Mormons, all of whom traveled to the very edge of religious doubt yet ultimately chose to remain committed Mormons. These intriguing personal journeys are explored in the context of the presenter's own crisis of faith. What emerges is an interesting picture of what goes on in the minds and hearts of thoughtful Mormons as they fight to keep faith alive."

But many people would be surprised to learn of the shamanic elements in the life of Emma Smith. While much has been published about male shamanic traditions, this session will explore the lesser-known forms and traditions of female shamanism and the evidence for their existence in the life and work of Emma Smith. It will also look at parallels between Mormonism and other shamanic religious and cultural traditions, ancient and contemporary."

What is the difference between the two? Can a person be religious and not spiritual; or spiritual and not religious? I argue that religiosity can masquerade as a form of spirituality but ultimately betrays it. In this session, I propose four unfortunate conditions that prevail when religiosity is allowed to reign over spirituality and which I believe many in older generations remain asleep to."

Rogers"	"SL08264, A Paradox of Moral Courage: The Tragic Story of Helmuth Huebener This session explores the moral courage that caused the young German Latter-day Saint Helmuth Huebener to put copies of BBC broadcasts in Hamburg telephone booths and city lamp posts-acts for which the Nazis eventually executed him. Huebener's story is full of paradoxes-many of them embedded with the LDS Church itself. In this session, I will demonstrate how these paradoxes function in Thomas S. Rogers's powerful drama, Huebener, and how this young man's courage continues to impact current Latter-day Saints. How might we learn to follow Huebener's example of questioning assumptions and seeking truth in humility and righteousness?"

Hales	"SL08265, Sexuality in Joseph Smith's Plurality In an 1844 publication, Joseph H. Jackson, a non-LDS visitor to Nauvoo, wrote: 'Joe Smith boasted to me that he â€_ from the commencement of his career had seduced 400 women.' If this is true, that would mean there would be 400 victims of Smith's debauchery. Ironically, the historical record fails to identify even one woman who said she was seduced by the Prophet. An in-depth review of available historical documents reveals a total of nineteen claims accusing Joseph Smith of sexual impropriety. In this session, I evaluate these claims for believability, emphasizing the difference between rumor, assumption, and credible evidence. I present extensive research that supports the probable existence of conjugal relations between Joseph Smith and nine of his plural wives, possible existence with another six, and doubtful existence with all non-wives and 'polyandrous' wives."

Even as President Beck was speaking, the Bloggernacle began to light up with discussion on her emphasis on mothers as nurturers and the examples she used to express her ideas. The talk evoked both strong feelings and deep contemplation, and even now, nearly a year later, it still garners discussion as LDS women and men have used it as a springboard to reflect on their personal experiences of knowing in terms of parenthood, perfection, nurturing, and scriptural interpretation. One diverse group of women used the energy of the discussion to develop a website, WhatWomenKnow.org, designed to expand the conversation about what it means to be an LDS woman. Panel members in this session will do a brief readers' theater performance that illustrates the process of the site's evolution. Then they will share their reasons for participating with WhatWomenKnow.org, their sense of both the positive and negative responses to the conversation and website, and their insights into diversity in the LDS woman's experience."

This panel will explore various aspects of Mitt Romney's recent presidential bid, ranging from its impact on outsider perceptions of Mormonism, its doctrines and people, to Mitt's and Mormonism's portrayal in political cartooning. In what ways has this campaign been an eye-opening experience for Latter-day Saints? Was his run ultimately a positive or a negative for the Church?

Even more surprising to them, however, has been the way their follow-up research has opened up new spiritual and historical understandings of LDS origins. Were there Sephardic Jews and Melungeons among early LDS and colonial American leaders? What is the significance of these ancestral tribes in Mormonism today? Do you have hidden Sephardic or Melungeon ancestry? If you're interested in learning about what could possibly be a major spirit- and mind-expanding adventure, come to this session!"

This frustration is often compounded by a feeling of voicelessness, as youth find it difficult to express their views at home or in church. In turn, parents and leaders can feel misunderstood as they try to express their beliefs while showing love. Prior to this panel session, professional mediator Jeffrey Nielsen will lead a group of young people, parents, and Church leaders in a multi-session dialogue about their beliefs, allowing them to share their perspectives openly while attempting to heal rifts that may exist."

The Mormon Quest for the Presidency This panel is a critical discussion of a just-published book, The Mormon Quest for the Presidency, co-authored by Newell G. Bringhurst and Craig L. Foster, which examines ten individuals with Mormon connections who ran for president of the United States. The first of these candidates was none other than Mormon founder Joseph Smith. Also featured is an extensive discussion of Mitt Romney's bid for the 2008 Republican nomination. Among the questions that the book discusses is why the candidacies of each of the ten failed, what role did Mormonism play in the failure of each, and when will the United States be ready for a Mormon president?

A common metaphor in these examples is one's life's journey. I will share examples of how examining alternate interpretations has helped me feel greater inspiration and increased my ability to apply the message to my own journey."

Walker Lewis, Enoch L. Lewis, and President Joseph T. Ball' & Paper 2. 'William McCarey (Alias Wm. Chubbee); Or The Magic Mulatto in Mormon Country' While Mormon historians have focused mostly on Elijah Abel, there is evidence that as many as seven men of African descent held Mormon priesthood before 1847. In this session, Connell O'Donovan will present biographies of three African American men from the Boston Branch who held Mormon priesthood and who influenced Brigham Young's instigation of the ban between 1847 and 1852. Patrick Polk's presentation focuses on the life of William McCarey. Described variously as African American, Native American, Spanish, and mixed-race, McCarey is an enigmatic figure whose activities as a Mormon convert, or at least those ascribed to him, have had a powerful and lasting impact on LDS racial perceptions and church policies regarding African Americans."

When Nephi states that his 'soul delighteth in plainness,' one must wonder just how he defined 'plainness.' So many things in the Book of Mormon and, by extension, throughout Mormonism, are far from plain. This presentation focuses on how much of Mormonism involves holding opposing thoughts and finding truth by reconciling them. Because the Book of Mormon teaches that there must needs be opposition in all things, this shouldn't be a problem within the faith."

Most philosophical arguments for God's existence have been aimed at justifying traditional Christian theology. However, Mormon theology, particularly as advocated by Joseph Smith near the end of his life, diverges from tradition to posit emergent gods that organize worlds from existing matter according to existing laws. Aiming at justifying Mormon theology, we have formulated a new argument for God's existence. The argument is based on assumptions widely shared among both secular andreligious persons, is consistent with modern science and technological trends, and concludes that we should trust that our world probably is created by advanced life forms more benevolent than we are. We invite philosophers, theologians, scientists, technologists, and anyone interested in such matters to come with your most critical eyes and ears. We are very interested in feedback, and a good portion of this session will be devoted to questions and criticisms."

Russell, Bill Hansen"	"SL08314, Seeing Joseph through Jesus's Eyes As the Community of Christ has dropped its traditional claims regarding exclusive authority and moved toward seeing their church as part of the body of Christ rather than as the body of Christ, there has been a greater emphasis on elements of faith members hold in common with the rest of the Christian world and less emphasis on unique Latter Day Saint doctrines. This process can be described as a move away from seeing Jesus through Joseph's eyes and toward seeing Joseph through Jesus' eyes."

Because contentious disagreements of teachers of religion over the interpretation of Biblical passages caused Joseph Smith to lose faith in the Bible's power to answer his religious questions, he retired to the woods to seek answers directly from God. Does the Mormon doctrine of continuing revelation solve the problems raised by variant texts and differing interpretations of scripture? What is the word of God? How is it given and received? And what is the relationship between scripture, revelation, and authority?"	SL08315	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL08315.mp3																				We'll Make the Air with Music Ring!

In this sing-your-own session, we'll explore the American musical roots of early LDS hymnody, from the Bay Psalm Book and New England fuguing tunes to The Sacred Harp. Mostly, though, we'll be joyfully noisy, with Kristine Haglund and Rebecca Stevenson singing, performing, and accompanying plenty of singing by the audience.

This presentation identifies historical developments that affect how and when this debate has unfolded and applies theoretical frameworks from the sociology of knowledge to explain how identification with different groups-including, potentially, the LDS Church, other religious communities, and scholarly discourse communities-influences a person's convictions about Book of Mormon historicity. I argue that how someone assesses the evidence for and against Book of Mormon historicity is fundamentally a question of how well socialized that person is into the Church. In other words, belief or disbelief in Book of Mormon historicity has less to do with intellectual issues per se than with the quality of a person's relationships with Latter-day Saints as compared to investments in other social groups."

That is, just because a particular practice has ended, it does not mean the ideology behind it has, too. The historical debate on this problem is not monolithic, yet two recent voices push the debate forward: Eugene England and Dwight Hopkins in the book, Mormonism in Dialogue with Contemporary Christian Theologies. This session explores methodological approaches to the problem of race and Mormonism; particularly in light of England's response to Hopkins on whether racism exists in the Mormon Church today."

Does current psychological theory offer any insight into the growing phenomenon of apostate Mormons who continue to obsess over LDS history and dogma, often with intense emotions of anger and loss? How might a skilled counselor knowledgeable about Mormonism and psychotherapy design a process to relieve the suffering of former or questioning Mormons so they can enjoy happier, more productive lives? Proceeding from the work on human individuation by social psychologist Erich Fromm, this presentation details the development of a series of compelling, cutting-edge theories regarding the inner world of the religious apostate.

Are we to assume that means all families, or just some families of a particular type? When the Proclamation warns of the 'disintegration' of family, what exactly does that mean? And what do 'responsive citizens and governments' do 'to promote those measures designed to maintain and strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of society?' What are we hearing from Church leaders to answer those questions and fill in the gaps?

And Which Way is That? When we witness the many messages our children are receiving at church, it is natural to wonder if the positive messages outweigh the negative and if there is a way to filter or counterbalance the negative messages our children are learning and absorbing. Should we stay active in the church for the children? Or, would they be better off if we chose to leave?

Shaken Faith Syndrome: Strengthening One's Testimony in the Face of Criticism and Doubt Using very selective presentations of the evidence, many groups target Mormons in the hope of creating doubt and disillusionment. And sometimes they succeed, as many Latter-day Saints are unaware that faith-shaking claims have been addressed time and again. A new book by Michael R. Ash, Shaken Faith Syndrome: Strengthening One's Testimony in the Face of Criticism and Doubt, examines the underlying misconceptions that contribute to de-conversion, suggests ways Latter-day Saints can strengthen their intellectual foundations against challenging issues, and then provides an even-handed and accurate framing of several of the most popular LDS-critical arguments.

The Children of Tantalus The play, The Children of Tantalus, features men of the postmodern, twentieth century who do not appear to fit normative standards of masculine behavior and desire, and are consequently led to question their sexuality. The story is told from the perspective of Ethan, a college-aged, gay Mormon, who shortly after the death of his father, begins to crave intimacy with his best (and married) friend, which sets him on a somewhat desperate and impulsive soul-searching path of sexual and religious identity. In the process, Ethan reveals the complex nature of his dilemma: the integrity of his faith and his love for Mormonism (and all that its theology of eternal marriage implies), and his genuine need for human affection."

Inspired by recent discussions among Mormon women, Becky has rededicated herself to becoming a 'wife who knows' (how to please her husband, that is) and in so doing discovered timeless wisdom from the classic treatise on the subject: Fascinating Womanhood, by Helen Andelin. And for the rising LDS generation, she has also plucked sparkling gems of wisdom about becoming a 'Beehive who wants to know' from the companion volume, Fascinating Girl.

Conversant in contemporary issues and informed about alternatives, the rising generation of Latter-day Saints is uniquely positioned to initiate positive change in the Church.

This presentation puts a finer point on Hill's thesis by arguing that Joseph Smith felt that American religious pluralism resulted from a breakdown in the perspicuity (or clarity) of the Bible. I suggest that Smith regarded hermeneutical (or interpretive) pluralism as an imminent threat to the coherence of his family and of American society and the Restoration was an attempt to resolve this crisis by restoring the Bible's perspicuity."

Conservative scholars downplay these contradictions by asserting that the Mormon god-concept has never changed while others argue that Joseph abandoned his earlier orthodox Trinitarianism in favor of a heterodox polytheism. Neither approach accounts for the content of Mormon authoritative texts that demonstrate that Joseph did not abandon, but rather complicated, his earlier teachings, leading to misunderstandings of his most controversial religious contributions. My paper seeks to promote for rising generations a spiritually unified interpretation that accounts for and gives equal dignity to the source texts of Joseph Smith's complex godhead doctrine."

Several Biblical texts will be used to illustrate Girard's theory. Then selected texts from the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price will be examined from a Girardian perspective. Topics will include the origin and purpose of ritual animal sacrifice, the Flood, the ancient ban on the Canaanites, and violent portrayals of God in Mormon texts."

This began a long struggle to understand his decision to leave our family and my faith in the LDS church. As a young mother and graduate student, I have finally found a way to reconcile my faith and my father's homosexuality and lifestyle. My personal autobiographical essay focuses on my discovery of his homosexuality, my mother's reaction to this event, and the healing that occurred afterwards. My spirituality has been shaped by this experience, but my complete acceptance and understanding of it did not occur until a year ago. This essay explores that path and how those of the LDS faith can deal with and understand homosexuality in a Christ-like and loving way."

Lee Smith, Kim Bateman"	"SL08362, 'The Divine Light: Understanding the Spirit of God In 1832, Joseph Smith revealed a concept that bridges scientific and spiritual sensibilities about the universe. Called the Light of Christ (or spirit of God), this primal energy source is not only defined as the life force, the source of enlightenment, and the intelligence from which we are made, but also explains many seeming mysteries regarding grace, atonement, and judgment. It also links LDS theology to Eastern mystic notions of the source of oneness with the mind of God and with each other. Awareness of these concepts transforms the way people live their religion. While these ideas fascinated early LDS theologians, recently they have gone unexplored. This session offers fresh perspectives to potentially re-invigorate this important discussion."

Given that Iraq has never attacked the United States, the war in Iraq is an offensive war-something vigorously condemned in the Book of Mormon and counter to the Doctrine and Covenants injunction that we 'renounce war and proclaim peace.'"

McLemore, Maxine Hanks"	"SL08364, Mystery: The Hidden Wisdom Throughout the centuries and within Mormonism as well, the word 'mystery' has taken on a variety of meanings in scriptural and spiritual discourse. But within all of these conversations, the essential element of the notion is 'that which is hidden.' Through radical and paradoxical discourse, Jesus and others have pointed to The Mystery but state 'few there be that find it.' What is it that is hidden from us? Why is it hidden and hard to find? How can I discover it, and how will it transform my life?"	SL08364	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL08364.mp3																				Is There Really Any Problem with Joseph Smith's First Vision? And Why Not?	"Richard K. Behrens, John P. Hatch"	"SL08365, Is There Really Any Problem with Joseph Smith's First Vision? And Why Not? Since Joseph Smith's First Vision is both the fundamental historical event and the basic theological tenet of Mormon thought, it has been the object of many attacks on Smith's credibility. Questions are generally raised concerning the content and the timing of the event because Joseph did not report on the event until more than twelve years after it occurred. Lucy Mack Smith, Joseph's mother, added to the problem by merging the First Vision and the 1823 visitation of the Angel Moroni to the Prophet in her history, which was prepared after Joseph's death and not subject to his review. This presentation addresses the timing and content issues through a careful analysis of the sequence of events that led up to the First Vision. It demonstrates why Joseph's account is most likely accurate."

The court's decision has drawn criticism from various quarters, including a 20 June letter from the LDS First Presidency urging California Church members to get involved in campaigning for a new ballot initiative defining marriage as only between one man and one woman. This panel will discuss several aspects of this ongoing controversy, including the legal doctrines at issue in the case, the ramifications for individuals, both inside and outside California, and the case's possible effect on other unpopular proposed marriage systems, such as plural marriage. It will also consider the Church's involvement in the context of both the earlier campaign to define marriage and this new one just getting underway.

While certainly not a fixture in the academy, Mormonism in the past few years has experienced a dramatic rise in academic interest, which in turn has led to the formation of a number of Mormon studies courses at colleges and universities nationwide. This panel is an opportunity to engage with scholars who have taught Mormon studies at a variety of academic institutions and to learn more about the challenges and opportunities that accompany this exciting area of study."

Seth Payne's presentation offers the results of research he has conducted on the exit narratives of so-called Mormon apostates. It places the narratives in an appropriate sociological framework and identifies common trends and structure for the narratives as a literary subgenre. Ryan Wimmer concentrates more on the directions Mormon dissenters take following their decision to leave Mormonism. Have many been able to assimilate into other faiths? Why do most modern dissenters seem to become atheistic or agnostic rather than finding another faith? Have they met in other traditions the same issues that troubled them about Mormonism?"

We believe this to be the first meeting of its kind to be held at the direction of the First Presidency. Affirmation leaders in this session will discuss the following questions: What are the puzzles, trials, and hopes associated with being young, gay, and Mormon? How does Affirmation help gay LDS men and women in their journey? How has the experience of being gay and Mormon evolved over the last thirty years?

Because it draws on documents not previously available to scholars and offers new angles on traditional sources, the book is being touted as the 'most thoroughly researched account of the massacre ever written.'

SMITH	"Mormon polygamy began in Nauvoo, Illinois, a river town located at a bend in the Mississippi about fifty miles upstream from MarkTwain's Hannibal, Missouri. After church founder Joseph Smith married some thirty-eight women, he introduced this ""celestial"" form of marriage to his innermost circle of followers. By early 1846, nearly 200 men had adopted the polygamous lifestyle, with an average of nearly four women per man—717 wives in all. After leaving Nauvoo, these husbands would eventually marry another 417 women, giving them an average of six wives apiece. In Utah, they were the polygamy pioneers who provided a model for thousands of others who entered into plural marriages in the nineteenth century. Their story is colorful, wrapped in images of people in the next life piloting celestial worlds. Plural marriage was not initiated all at once, nor was it introduced through a smooth progression of events but rather in fits and starts, through defenses and denials, hubris and mea culpas. The story, as told here, emphasizes the human drama, interspersed with underlying historiographical issues of uncovering what has been hidden—of explaining behavior that was once allowed and then denied as circumstances changed."

The panel’s title does not mean that we live in a church where being single does not produce angst. Indeed, nearly all Mormon singles experience some kind of pressure or anxiety.

But Black Latter-day Saints who have some history in the Church remember when racialist policies kept them from full participation in the Church and justified some appalling assumptions about them. Today, many of our young people have no idea that there was a priesthood restriction. This presentation will include anecdotes and provide resources, giving cause for hope, and also cause for concern. How far have we come since 1978?

CARRIE MILES	"Some women attempting to escape from polygamy have complained that LDS bishops they consulted advised them to return to their husbands because “We are all going to have to live polygamy someday.” LDS theology distinguishes between “higher” laws--what God really wants us to do--and “lower” laws, which we have to settle for because the higher law cannot be practiced under current earthly circumstances. Despite the Church’s opposition to its contemporary practice, plural marriage continues to be viewed as the higher law that will be practiced in heaven. Comparing Old Testament examples of polygamy (and my experience with polygamy in Africa today) with New Testament teachings about marriage raises the question, however: Is plural marriage really a higher law after all?"

Todd Compton	"The raid on the Folds compound in Texas has brought polygamy to national attention and in particular the Folds tendency for older men to marry young teens as polygamous wives. This has caused some non-Mormon observers to point out that in his mid-thirties, Joseph smith married teenage girls, including a 14-year-old. Conservative Mormons responded that in Joseph Smith's time, young teen brides were common. This paper will review the American history of family life to answer the question: what was the normal marriage age in Joseph smith's culture?

For these tight-knit groups, expectations of sexual purity and controlling marriage serve as barriers to the outside world, perpetuating the ethnic-based religion. While the Community of Christ may share much of the same canon and early history with LDS Mormonism, there are important divergences regarding homosexuality. exploring commonalities and differences is useful for saints from both churches who are seeking understanding, healing, and reconciliation. in examining conceptions of Zion, I hope to contribute to individual and collective actions that are true to our common Restoration heritage and understandings of human worth."

This prohibition abruptly ended in 1978 with the termination of the priesthood and temple ban against those of African descent. This paper traces public and private anti-miscegenation statements made by early Church leaders, including Joseph Smith–from expressions of disgust and horror bolstered by scriptural proof-texting and prophetic language to shore up its theological foundations, to 20th Century political accusations of a joint “negro” and Communist conspiracy to bring societal and moral upheaval to the United states."

Since its canonization in 1880, most LDS members have viewed the Book of Moses as a restoration of lost truth grounded in historical events. However, converging lines of evidence from Mormon history, the reevaluation of the Joseph smith Translation, and textual criticism of both the Hebrew Bible and restoration scriptures have undermined this assumption, creating an increasingly marginal place for the Book of Moses in the LDS canon. The need to reevaluate the paradigm used to understand the Book of Moses creates difficult questions and promising possibilities for the discussion of historicity, methodology, and canonical status for LDS leaders, scholars, and members. Paper 2: ""The Myth of the Missing Book of Abraham Papyrus."" The ""missing papyrus theory"" has gained ground as the most popular Book of Abraham apologetic. Defenders of this theory have exaggerated the quantity of papyrus that is missing from the present collection—and in so doing, have hindered the progress of serious historical understanding of the origins and meaning of the Book of Abraham. When eyewitness testimony and physical evidence are examined through responsible historical methodologies, we find not only that the corpus of missing papyrus is much smaller than has been claimed, but also that the ostensible source of the Book of Abraham is among the extant fragments."

Smith	"Mormon polygamy (sometimes called “big love”) might have roots in Hebrew writings; however, Mormon Celestial Marriage was first alluded to in the Book of Mormon and was later shared with 200 men and more than 700 women in Nauvoo, Illinois, between 1841 and 1846. at first practiced in silence because it was against Illinois law, Nauvoo polygamy was disrupted by an internal revolt which resulted in the arrest and assassination of the Mormon prophet and expulsion of the saints from Illinois. Polygamy was first announced in the salt lake valley in 1852, but was never retroactively included in the adumbrated history of Nauvoo. When the U.s. government pressured the saints to end plural marriage circa 1890, a process of institutional forgetting ensued. More than a century later, the HBO series Big Love portrays family life in modern polygamous households, while those men who pioneered the early practice of Celestial Marriage in Nauvoo are still inaccurately depicted in Church instruction manuals as having had only one wife.

Jepson	"Within the world of Stephenie Meyer's Twilight novels, a mode of romantic relationship called “imprinting”–instigated by sudden recognition and then lasting eternally–bears a strong similarity to the premortal romance popularized in Mormon literature since the publication of Nephi Anderson's Added Upon. In basic structure, the premortal romance begins before mortality and drives the lovers to find their soul mate in mortality. The moment of recognition between the premortal lovers resembles the moment of imprinting between Meyer's werewolves. This paper compares Twilight's werewolf imprinting with the premortal lovers in added upon and Saturday's Warrior."

This session will explore where our spiritual paths have taken us and what questions we’ve attempted to answer along the way. What led you to spiritual seeking? Have you explored traditions and spiritual beliefs outside of Mormonism, such as other Christian faiths, or Buddhism, or Taoism? What conclusions have you come to regarding god, what happens after we die, and why evil exists?

Often women find themselves in the crosshairs if their life choices are out of sync with ideals touted by society, church, or their own family upbringing. given the demands of various stages of motherwork, how can we make good decisions and seek balance? What support do we want or need from church, the men in our lives, our friends, and family? How can women support each other–even when we don’t agree on the answers?"

She is the director of the first groundbreaking, comprehensive study of LGBT adolescents and their families, Showing that parents, families, and religious communities can have a profound effect on the prevalence of depression, suicide, substance abuse, and risk for HIV infection among homosexuals. Dr. Ryan is developing a new evidence-based approach to help families decrease LGBT children’s risk for serious health problems and promote their well-being based on specific accepting and rejecting behaviors of parents, families, and caregivers.

Bringhurst	"This presentation focuses on two millenarian revelations attributed to Mormon Church founder, Joseph smith, specifically, his 1832 “Revelation and Prophecy on War” and the so-called “White Horse Prophecy.” Both revelations were highly publicized and familiar to both Latter-day Saints and non-Mormons alike. In addition to comparing and contrasting these two prophecies, I will also discuss the impact of these documents on the Latter-day Saint community as well as on American society in general during the course of the 19th, 20th, and 21st Centuries."

Her transformation from heterosexual housewife and non-practicing ""cultural Christian"" to becoming a priest led directly to her coming out as a lesbian. This is a challenging notion for many within Christianity (including many Mormons) who regard homosexuality or homosexual behavior as sinful. Yet Susan's most intimate experience of the divine is one of confirmation that she should be the person–and the priest–that god made her to be. Susan's story defies stereotypes, challenges orthodoxies and provides a catalyst for examining our own lives, ethics, and beliefs. For Mormon audiences, the film poses questions concerning the ethics of listening, our engagement with the other, and the terms and possibility of interfaith dialogue."

The will of the majority led to Mormons being driven from their homes and massacred and their leaders assassinated. Modern-day Mormons are cognizant that our ancestors were wronged, but may be less aware of the striking parallels with the historical treatment of homosexuals. Most Mormons voted for Proposition 8 because the Prophet said it was essential to “protect traditional marriage.” I believe Mormons can protect marriage as instructed by Church leaders as well as allow for civil liberties and rights of homosexuals. I discuss some ideas that will help convince moderate and liberal Mormons that in civil society (which is separate from religious community), it is appropriate and even beneficial to allow gay and lesbian couples to marry."

Nichols, Whitney Nelson"	"Whitney Nelson reads excerpts from her feminist nonfiction piece “Raked,” which tells the story of her experience as a young female athlete finding herself on the fringes of LDS beliefs and culture both before and after her parents’ divorce. Nichols analyzes “Raked” as both nonfiction and individual narrative using Owen Barfield’s argument that in the evolution of language lies irrefutable evidence that the (Christian, LDS) narrative of original participation, fall, and transformative rebirth is the narrative of human consciousness."

A Lingering Look at a Troubling Text	Bill Heersink	"Women, authority, church—deciding how those three words should connect has been the source of much pain in the past century and also in the first century. One New Testament chapter in particular provides a window on conflict arising in the early church over this issue. Paul’s supposed settlement seemed to have resolved the matter for centuries to come. But now most Protestant denominations have faced, are facing, or will be facing the question again. Through a careful consideration of I Timothy 2, this paper will relate the journey of one male who pastored congregations for 35 years and taught would-be pastors for ten. What is the applicability for Latter-day Saints?"

Understanding her frame of mind at that point is difficult without looking more closely at her lifetime experiences. Many sources record the events in Emma’s life—and some with valuable detail. The frequent moves, the death of her children, the severe persecution and the development of plural marriage all had their impact on Emma. Richard uses his training as a counselor/social worker to better understand Emma's frame of mind, her responses to hardships and loss, and her decision to remain in Illinois rather than moving West."

I will discuss my experience participating in a two-year spiritual direction program and how my perceptions of religion and spirituality changed. I finished the program with my gratitude for my LDS background intact, but my LDS certainty tattered. I will discuss my relationship with other members of the program, many of whom were ordained ministers, and my experience with Eucharist. The truth is, I am exploring my own good red road."

Some Latter-day Saints have been troubled by the seeming contradiction of his involvement in magic. This paper seeks to demonstrate how tension between current notions of appropriate religious practice and historical data on Smith continues to shape critical and apologetic assessments of his claims. It will also raise questions about the utility of the term “pious fraud” in characterizing Joseph's religious activities.

Toscano	"Without apology, Mormons proclaim their belief that both God the Father and Jesus Christ are embodied beings with separate identities. While a belief in a Heavenly Mother is also an official doctrine of the LDS Church, her nature and divine status are less clear. In addition, the introduction of a Heavenly Mother raises the troubling question of divine sexuality. How literally should we view divine embodiment? Is a female God necessary to elevate the status of women? Why has the transcendent God usually been pictured as male? Since women have traditionally been linked with the body and the earth, is it necessary to redeem the idea of embodiment itself in order to redeem women’s position? Does eternal embodiment limit eternal progression or enhance it? Is personhood possible without a gendered body?"

Toscano, Sonja Farnsworth, Taryn Nelson Seawright"	"The issue of women and priesthood inevitably emerges in discussions about women’s roles in Mormonism since the priesthood is the organizing principle for everything in the LDS Church from ordinances to missionary work. If women do not have access to priesthood, can they have full equality or fully utilize their gifts in the Church? We will have panelists who represent various positions: 1) women have priesthood and should be allowed to exercise it in the Church, 2) women’s priesthood functions on a private level, 3) women don’t need priesthood to fully use their spiritual gifts in the Church, 4) motherhood for women is the equivalent of priesthood for men"	SL09131	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL09131.mp3																				SL09132 Panel: Mormons and Mediums: LDS Women’s Pursuit of Mediated and Non-mediated Communication with the Dead	"Carolyn Campbell, Deloris Beynon, Laura L. Bush, Doe Daughtrey, Pepper Gregory"	"This panel will explore Mormon women’s mediated and non-mediated experiences with their dead ancestors, as well as personal and cultural biases for and against communicating with the dead. Beynon and Gregory will discuss how their faith journeys have been shaped by both their work as mediums and their experience as Mormons. They will also discuss how they see their particular spiritual gifts contributing to Mormon culture. Bush and Daughtrey will explore the reasons contemporary Mormon women (such as they and others) pursue direct or indirect experiences with the dead outside of traditional Mormon practices, either through developing their own psychic gifts or through the mediation of a medium."

Questions we will examine include an analysis of the Mormon readings of Eve\'s role in the Eden story, subjectivity and embodiment in Mormonism, and connections between relational understandings of God in mainstream feminist theology and LDS teachings. In doing this, we hope to not only delve into specific issues of Mormon feminism, but also to illustrate the variety of approaches available for future work in the area."

Holly Welker	"Produced by BYU in 1969, the short film Johnny Lingo is often cited as a wise, compassionate story of male sensitivity to female identity, a positive demonstration of how to foster female self-worth. But the story hinges on the idea that a woman’s self-esteem is based on the price she commands in a financial transaction between men, not on any internal sense of who she is. This paper will present a close reading of the film, examine some implications of this financial transaction, and consider more realistic and modern ways than the barter system of encouraging female self-respect."

Pyle told the public he wanted “to protect the lives and futures of 263 children” in a community “dedicated to the production of white slaves.” The raid was an expensive failure and cost Pyle his office. In April 2008, Schleicher County, Texas authorities raided the 1700-acre YFZ Ranch and seized 439 FLDS children with almost identical justification and results. Both raids played to the same stereotypes, drove the FLDS inward, and were financial disasters for the states. Didn’t anybody read history?"

There is, however, a surprising lack of non-conversion stories. In particular, when a person has been immersed in Mormon studies for as long as I’ve been, how have I escaped the waters of baptism? This paper takes a kind but firm look at the several overarching reasons why I’m not a member. I begin with my puzzlement over why Mormonism begins with a sound spiritual message and then mucks it up with all kinds of distractions, and move on to other puzzlements about the Church’s teaching versus its practice."

Mythed Again: The Strange Persistence of Certain Questionable Teachings in Today’s Mormonism [Partial]	Steve Warren	"For mainstream Latter-day Saints to foul up occasionally on doctrinal questions is no big deal. We all do it. But when a questionable teaching originates from the Church’s top leaders, it becomes a larger problem. That’s because in today’s Church, we tend to treat concepts as true merely because they come from the prophet, First Presidency, or Twelve. Ere long, the dubious doctrines or teachings creep into manuals, magazines, classes, and talks, and we’re stuck with them. In this session, I will explore twelve questionable teachings that have been propounded by top Church leaders and have been widely believed. By examining them, perhaps we can magnify our capacity to detect and weed out other dubious teachings."

[Partial]	Janice Allred	"Feminist theologians have responded to the feminist challenge to an exclusively male God by exploring the feminine attributes of God, pointing out feminine metaphors describing God, and seeking to develop a more inclusive language to speak about God. The Mormon doctrine of divine embodiment requires that Mormon theologians go further. Our teaching that God the Father is an embodied male who is the literal father of our spirits requires that a heavenly mother exist, but is she a member of the Godhead? This paper will look critically at the Mormon-Christian doctrine of the Godhead and present an interpretation of the scriptures that includes God the Mother in the Godhead."

(Jack) Worlton	"This session will expand on the 7th Article of Faith: “We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly.” To understand the Bible requires considerable study, not only because of translation issues but because books of the Bible were written by people who lived as many as three thousand years ago in cultures not even remotely similar to our own, in languages that few readers now understand, and translated from manuscripts whose originals no longer exist. Fortunately, there is a large growth industry whose mission is to provide aids for Bible study. Unfortunately, many are sectarian and intend to persuade rather than to enlighten. This session will analyze the nature of the problems facing Bible students and Bible lovers and offer some suggestions to make the Bible more accessible."

By comparing official Church rhetoric about the priesthood both before and after the removal of the ban, one can analyze the rhetoric about women’s place within both the Church and the religious family structure.

Although Deseret News editor Joel Campbell called the portrayal “religious pornography,” and a campaign was launched to boycott HBO, some Mormons felt the depiction was in good taste—even inspiring. We will shift away from the HBO depiction to explore the debate surrounding the show, asking ourselves: What does the controversy say about how the world perceives the Church, the Church perceives the world, and how Mormons perceive themselves?

Nonetheless, blogs about mothering flourish as an online medium where women write about, process, and compare notes on the experiences, challenges, and joys of mothering.

Our panel will explore the personal, spiritual, and institutional implications of the current power dynamics in the LDS Church and discuss what other models and approaches might be possible.We'll hear from panelists on many sides of the issue—an LDS woman whose access to power in the Church is either informal or primarily as a recipient; a black man who first experienced exclusion from exercising power and then inclusion after the 1978 revelation on blacks and the priesthood; a Community of Christ apostle whose denomination wrestled with the issue and subsequently opened the priesthood to women; and a gay man whose use of priesthood is somewhat tenuous and contingent upon foregoing committed same-sex relationships to remain in good standing with the Church. Finally, we'll hear from an organizational psychologist who will analyze the power dynamics in the Church and the ramifications to the organization for including and excluding some individuals from the power/authority structure."

More than just establishing a house of order, by surrounding ourselves with beauty, we can enrich our lives and the lives of others. Families and children are especially impacted by their interior surroundings. Effectively designed interior spaces not only promote feelings of calm, rest, and repose, but they also can also produce enthusiasm, energy, and motivation. By applying basic interior design principles of color, scale, and proportion, it is possible to achieve a visual harmony in our homes that is in concert with the Gospel."

It is time to acknowledge and confess as faith communities the pressures and restrictions women often experience in religious culture. Texts of scripture provide divine guidance and inspired insight for life when responsibly interpreted and faithfully applied. However, texts must be read, overheard, and absorbed so that lives lived might be both formed and transformed by the witness of scripture. This can happen in the act of proclamation. What will be proclaimed is a word about and through the main character, Tamar, David's daughter who is raped by her brother Amnon.In this powerful text, many of the controlling issues of patriarchy and the subjection of women, which severely limit the options women can exercise, are exposed. The implications of this text for women in church and culture are immense. Here is a text of terror that has the potential of lancing our comfort and complicity with things as they are and our inclinations to suppress what is just by not rocking the boat."

Still, it impacts their lives in numerous ways, especially in terms of policies and procedures about which they are not informed and into which they had no input but which they can unknowingly trespass. This paper will compare the 2006 CHI with its 1999 counterpart, especially modifications and changes. It will also explore the larger context of hierarch and member in which, presumably, most of the active roles are assigned to the hierarch and most of the passive roles to the member. What assumptions are made about gender roles that, though not expressed in specific policies, still affect the view of women and men differentially in the Handbook?"

Koyle, who was a Mormon bishop at the time, claimed he had been shown where to dig by Moroni, the same heavenly messenger who had led Mormon founder Joseph Smith to unearth the golden plates. Moroni visited Koyle in a dream and showed him nine enormous caverns inside the mountain containing countless piles of gold. Moroni told Koyle that the gold would remain hidden in the caves until an unspecified time preceding the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. At that moment of chaos, Koyle and his followers would unearth the gold and it would support the financially-troubled LDS Church through the Last Days. This paper investigates the nature of belief in the Dream Mine, which remains fervent more than one hundred years later. Although shareholders’ dreams are perpetually deferred, believers tap into a rich vein of folklore that runs through Mormon cosmology. This presentation will consider how Dream Mine belief has evolved in a changing economic, political, and religious landscape and demonstrate that the faithful find sustenance in the Mormon past while simultaneously embracing modern worldviews that extend beyond mainstream Mormonism."

First, I will examine how, in their attempt to restore Mormon historical sites, the LDS Church creates simulacra, sites where the representations have only a tangential relationship to reality. However, despite the “constructedness” of these historical restorations, these fabrications have real effects. Second, I also discuss how the tours construct testimony, especially evident in their three-step presentations that move from historical context, to didactic moral lesson, to spiritual declarations."

Most explanations of the atonement lead to a belief in a deity who supports or uses violence to redeem the world. These theories not only justify violence but argue for a God whose nature is at odds with the God manifest in the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. Such theories not only obfuscate the nature of God but reduce Jesus to an empty vessel whose purpose seems more in line with a sacrificial animal than an actual individual with a vocation or work to perform. It disconnects Jesus\' life, where we encounter his actual words, deeds, and his vision of God\'s kingdom, and instead gives us an icon. This in turn allows us to justify our own violent actions in the world. I will look at a number of scriptural passages arguing for a new interpretation not based upon the myth of redemptive violence. I will also show historical examples of how atonement theology interplays with conflicts of war and other acts of violence."

The prophet was uncomfortable with public speaking while the Baptist was a seasoned orator and the leader of the largest group of converts. Sidney was named Joseph’s spokesman at their first meeting. What attracted him to the new movement? What qualified him to become the public face of Mormonism so early? And years before the Spalding theory of the Book of Mormon origins was advanced, why did Baptists suspect Rigdon of being the real founder of Mormonism?

Susan Elizabeth Howe and Robert Rees read and criticized my entire oeuvre and helped me choose those poems worthy of inclusion in a published collection.

Given the lay nature of LDS leadership, teachers and advisors in a church setting may not have previous experience working with special needs children. What can leaders and individual members do to help and support parents and children at church? What expertise can parents share with leaders to help make church activity a positive experience? What resources exist for special needs children/youth?"	SL09233	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL09233.mp3																				SL09234 Panel: Divine Malfeasance [Partial]	"Holly Welker, Michael J. Stevens, Doe Daughtrey, Stephen Carter, Parker Blount"	"Richard Nixon claimed, “If the president does it, it’s not illegal,"" a tenet of Christianity seems to be, “If God does it, it’s not evil.” Thus, the destruction of most of humanity in the flood isn’t genocide but compassionate loving-kindness (Noah and animals saved, rainbows); the command that Abraham kill his son isn’t psychological cruelty or conspiracy to commit murder but compassionate loving-kindness (ram in thicket). Holocaust victims tried God for crimes against humanity; the satirical website The Onion reported a lawsuit against God for breach of promise. Should Mormons follow suit? What do we gain if we consider seriously the concept of divine malfeasance? What do we lose?"

Russell	"In April 1984, RLDS Church President Dr. Wallace B. Smith presented to the church’s World Conference a proposed revelation which, among other things, called for the church to begin ordaining women. The issue had been festering in the church for at least fifteen years and was very controversial. Approximately twenty percent of the delegates voted against the motion to accept the document as a revelation to be included in the Doctrine and Covenants, and approximately the same percentage of active members ceased their involvement in the church as a result. It was a watershed moment in the history of the RLDS Church (since 2001 the Community of Christ), and the church today is in some ways difficult to recognize compared to the church that existed a generation ago. Robin K. LinkhartCommunity of Christ’s Section 156 was canonized in 1984. This paper will explore traditional Christian patriarchal hierarchy, Latter Day Saint organizational culture, and the journey of women breaking new ground as ordained ministers in the Community of Christ. Seventy Robin K. Linkhart, missionary coordinator for the West Central USA Mission Field, will share her personal experience."

The 180-year Controversy Over the Book of Mormon Witnesses"	Don Bradley	"Did Joseph Smith hypnotize the Book of Mormon witnesses? Did he palm off copper or tin plates on them as gold? Were their experiences visions, physical perceptions of ancient artifacts, or the fabrications of a conspiracy? Each of these explanations has been proffered since the witnesses laid down their challenge in the summer of 1829. In my paper, part of Sunstone’s Mapping Mormon Issues project, I’ll explore this controversy—its origin, unfolding, and future. I’ll point out where the attempted explanations have succeeded and where they have failed, identify overlooked evidence, and offer new perspective on the debate and the meaning of these foundational experiences."

Rees	"How would our understanding of scriptural parables, allegories, and narratives, as well as Church history, be enlarged and enlightened if told through a woman’s understanding and experience? Taking as a model the imaginative expansions and extrapolations of scripture by ancient Jewish rabbis and contemporary Jewish women, this session invites Latter-day Saints to re-imagine their scripture, history, and tradition from a feminist point of view and with a feminist sensibility (as least as far as one man can imagine it!)."

Andrew Bolton	"Latter Day Saint militarism peaked in Nauvoo with the 5,000-strong Nauvoo Legion under the command of Lt. General Joseph Smith Jr. Militarism also appears to be correlated with patriarchy and in Nauvoo included both the beginning of polygamy and resistance to it by women led by Emma Smith through the Women’s Relief Society. This paper argues that, perhaps influenced more by his mother Emma than his father, Joseph III laid the foundations in the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS) of a possible peace church as he and others reacted against the militarism and polygamy of Nauvoo. This paper analyzes the Reorganization/Community of Christ’s difficult journey to embrace both the equal role of women and the pursuit of peace."

The resulting imbalance leads away from perfection and a wholeness. There exists a spiritual imperative to embrace the soul mate of the self, the marriage, and the Divine. In each developmental union, the feminine and masculine energies are balanced, the ego is displaced, and the shadow is owned instead of blamed on others. Otherwise, we remain a house divided, fragmented, and disconnected. The resulting dysfunction is manifested on all levels of our lives: personally, relationally, spiritually, and institutionally."

In this paper, I will analyze revelatory dreams as discussed by general authorities since 1971. My analysis will suggest that dreams are still considered revelatory and used in the context of telling faith-promoting stories—but with a difference: While leaders once were eager to share with the church their most personal intimations, more recent leaders have retreated to a less charismatic mode, preferring to retell famous dreams from the past rather than sharing their own."

Has virginity become a type of cult? This paper will also explore the connection between chastity and pornography for both men and women. What happens when a woman's primary value is sexual, through motherhood, wifedom, and chastity? Is there a way to defend your sexuality, take control of it, without breaking the commandments set forth? How should young women be taught about sex? What should they be taught about their bodies? How should single women live their lives without being nuns and burying sexual desires?"

Reed	"The cross taboo was a late development in Mormon history, manifesting itself at the grass-roots level around the 1900s and later being institutionalized as protocol in the 1950s by President David O. McKay. Previously, many Saints used and promoted the symbol in its visual and material form. This paper will explain why the early Mormon mainstream did not initially buy into the anti-cross polemics that typically came from American Protestants during the time that the Church was organized. Additionally, I will illuminate how and why the cross aversion later came about."

"Lavina Fielding Anderson, Andrew Bolton, Gary James Bergera"	"Unlike the Community of Christ, the LDS Church has no formally defined history principles, but it does have fairly clear positions enunciated by officials on various levels toward various historical events and attitudes. This panel discusses the origins and implementation of these nine principles in the Community of Christ with particular attention to the questions: What problems are these principles supposed to solve? If there were a parallel LDS set of principles, what would they say, and what principles are they supposed to solve? How are both approaches working so far? What might be some unintended consequences for both faith movements?"

Barney, Carol Hamer, Lisa Butterworth, Cheryl Lund Bruno, Melanie Franti"	"Picture a Mormon woman. Many specific traits come to mind, some profound, some superficial. Even if many of the stereotypical traits fit, they don't fit everyone, and sometimes they fit in unexpected ways. Blogging helps to break down stereotypes because superficial barriers like age, race, economic class, and geographic location are stripped away, and people meet others who wouldn't normally be in the same real-life social community. By exchanging ideas and stories, whole categories of people—that one person might ordinarily have mentally filed as ""other""—come to life. Because blogging isn't just broadcasting but is two-way communication, the blogger challenges other people's prejudices about her at the same time as she expands her own horizons by learning about others. Mormon women bloggers have seized their ambassador role with gusto, showing the diversity of the Mormon community while finding common ground with people in other communities."

Can we get control of violence before we destroy ourselves? Can we take care of the planet before we destroy it? Can we re-imagine human flourishing? Hope keeps the future open. Hope is one of the virtues (faith, hope, and charity) and, at least in my life, needs shoring up.

Russell	"Why did Jesus begin the supreme sermon of all time with these eight statements? What was he trying to tell us? Did he have in mind something greater than the sum of the parts? We usually treat the Beatitudes as a laundry list of the desirable traits of a Christian or the qualities associated with taking upon ourselves the divine nature. What if Jesus intended them to be a set and listed in this particular order? Third Nephi adds eight words that help unlock the key to understanding the objective.

Her immediate and somewhat indignant response was: “It means the men are in charge!” LDS theology describes gender-specific roles that some observers claim place women beneath men in importance or value. Do core doctrines taught by Joseph Smith and other modern prophets truly support this assessment? Do these gender-specific roles continue after mortal death and into eternity? Do exalted women feel inferior to exalted men? Is polygamy demeaning to women or a benefit available only to females, a benefit that comprises a minor component of the eternal patriarchal order? While there is much that we do not know, the scriptures and modern prophets have provided important hints."

Some have picked up negative associations about Sonia Johnson and Mormons for ERA from parents or others who felt that speaking out publicly against the LDS Church was inappropriate. We'll review Sonia's outspoken support of the ERA, how it led to her excommunication, and explore whether she had lasting influence on women in the Church—or on the Church itself. We'll also discuss whether there are differences between Mormon feminists today and 1970s activists and whether Church rhetoric about women has shifted in the 30 years since Sonia made headlines."

This presentation will outline how this interpretive strategy will enable a more adequate reading of the Book of Mormon, including the perceived aims and purposes of Joseph Smith Jr. himself, and will argue that without this approach, it is impossible to adequately understand the word and witness of the Book of Mormon."

As peace activists, we’ll share our experiences, along with those of other contemporary activists, and look back into the lives of Mormons such as Bathsheba Smith and her work with the women’s suffrage movement and use those experiences as a lens through which to better understand scriptural figures such as Enoch, Mormon, and Daniel.

I will touch on both her life-long career as a writer, propelled by her great wit and intellect, and her chosen position as a parent of six and proponent of motherhood and the family. I will examine views Sister Cannon held and remarks she made of both a traditional and a progressive nature. She was what’s called a “working woman,” but she also held tight to traditional motherhood. She related, in a way, to all kinds of women."

There has been a tremendous democratization of the publishing process almost across the board, which is exciting news for most authors. But in Mormonism, the consolidation of Deseret Book’s reach into both publishing and retail has actually put the squeeze on independent authors and publishers. What does the new “85/15” mix (the idea that 85% of the product in Deseret stores needs to be from Deseret Book) mean for independent publishers and authors? If it’s harder than ever to get distribution in Deseret’s retail stores, what other avenues are available for authors and publishers? What’s the next frontier in Mormon publishing?"

Beginning with Drury’s ""Advise and Consent"" (1959), it examines the writings of Mormons writing from “inside the culture,” and non-Mormons’ responding from “outside the culture.” Emerging themes in the more than fifty works published over the past fifty years include the struggling Mormon missionary, the teen, and even the married adult; coming out to self, family, and Church; the decision to leave or to attempt assimilation in the church; how Church publications and statements impact the lives of members; violence by and against Mormons; the gay Mormon character in commercial films; and the emerging gay Mormon drama from Kushner’s ""Angels in America"" (1991) to Fales’s ""Missionary Position"" (2009)."

While the scriptures are clear regarding the requirement to forgive, they may not satisfy our need to understand why or how. We may feel confused—perhaps even offended—when we read the scripture, ""he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin""(D&C 64:9). If someone committed a major sin against me—betrayed or robbed me of something or someone precious to me—how could it be an even greater sin for me not to forgive him? Why isn’t it appropriate to want justice? What are the obstacles that prevent us from forgiving others and finding healing and relief? When grievances grow to hatred, we become slaves of the very persons who have harmed us. We are bound to them with chains that leave us no peace. None of us can afford to pay the price of carrying grudges or harboring bitterness, because of what it does to us."

Petersen	"Retellings of the biblical Adam and Eve narrative proliferated in nineteenth-century literature; however, the retellings took a decidedly Gnostic turn, reversing the binary oppositions of good and evil, and taking a post-enlightenment view of knowledge. From the start, Mormonism has been a “Romantic” religion: the Adam and Eve narrative took center stage with Joseph Smith introducing three new versions of the narrative; like their literary cousins, these sacred texts took a radically Gnostic turn. Knowledge is a boon rather than a curse; the fall is fortunate rather than fatal; and Eve is a hero rather than a pariah. In this paper, I will begin to situate Joseph Smith's retellings of the Adam and Eve narrative within nineteenth-century poetic production and look at issues of gender, theology, and American identity."

McLemore	"The mystical union of male and female as the birth of spiritual awakening has been a core teaching of many ancient spiritual traditions. Unlike many “modern” religions, Mormonism reflects this ancient teaching by having celestial marriage as its highest ordinance. Sadly, this ordinance and the teachings surrounding it remain centered on the eternal relationship of a man and a woman—when the highest expression of the oneness of male and female is found in Knowing God as Jesus knew him. Through his parable of The Ten Virgins, Jesus invites all of us, both male and female, to become his brides through a wonderful spiritual seduction and into an intimate relationship in which we can “know as we are known."

At the heart of intra-religious conflict is the feeling of betrayal. The heretic is a member of the family who has chosen to destroy the family from within. This treachery is personal. But it feels different for the heretic, who feels she is “believing more” than the group is and wants to elevate it to a higher vision than it has for itself. The first part of this session, presented in the voices of the “faithful” Mormon member and the “heretic” will unpack the complex, painful heart of this type of conflict. In the second part, experienced voice-dialogue facilitator John Kesler will lead session attendees in an experiential process that will take them deeply into the personal dynamics of heresy."

It is a history of the most powerful people experiencing events divorced from daily life. What insights can be gained from a history that shifts its focus to people and places more familiar: our homes, neighborhoods, and workplaces? Julie Hemming Savage, author of Women Making America, will share her insights into the relevance of women’s history and its power to enliven our lives and feed our souls by allowing us to see our families and ourselves as the creators of history."

Interpreting Stephenie Meyer’s Twilight Myth	"Maxine Hanks, Holly Welker, Davis Farnsworth, Doe Daughtrey, Jana K. Riess"	"Mormon mom and BYU grad Stephenie Meyer created a myth so compelling, her Twilight series sold 42 million books worldwide and migrated to the movie screen and grossed $188 million. As the bestselling fiction author of 2008, Meyer is the biggest publishing phenomenon since J.K. Rowling. She has sold more books than any Mormon author except Joseph Smith and is the most commercially successful Mormon writer since Orson Scott Card and Stephen R. Covey. Her vision of ethical vampires is violent and redemptive, addictive and satiating, prosaic and provocative, with hints of deeper meaning buried in a narrative of teen angst. What is the magic in her myth that captivates so many readers? Is her netherworld a dreamscape others long to inhabit? Does Mormonism shape her work? How do religious themes or ideas emerge in her work? What do her books say about her and her readers?"

However, both men and women, and even teenagers, from inside the polygamous culture have spoken out publicly in order to dispel stereotypes and to educate Fundamentalist Mormon families. Several from outside the polygamous culture have made a special effort to learn about the polygamous lifestyle and to see that services are available to plural families if warranted.

Miles	"Some women attempting to escape polygamy have complained that LDS bishops they consulted advised them to return to their husbands because “We are all going to have to live polygamy someday.” LDS theology distinguishes between “higher” laws—what god really wants us to do—and “lower” laws we settle for because the higher law cannot be practiced under current earthly circumstances. despite the church’s opposition to its contemporary practice, plural marriage continues to be viewed as the higher law that will be practiced in heaven. comparing old testament examples of polygamy (and my experience observing polygamy in Africa today) with new testament teachings about marriage raises the question: is plural marriage really a higher law after all?"

Shipps’ model is informed, useful, and—I will argue—mistaken.Mormonism’s Judaic character is intrinsic, not acquired. The object of this paper is to demonstrate the insufficiency of even the best of the existing models, such as the “strata” model offered by Jan Shipps, and to propose a model that makes use of her insights, agrees with the earliest evidence, and accounts for Mormonism’s distinctively Judaic brand of Christianity."

Thus, the “living word” of revelation and the “dead letter” of sacred scripture constitute two poles that stand diametrically opposed. However, history has provided us with two communities that successfully bridged the perceived chasm between extra-textual revelation and written scripture.

Loren Franck	"At an early age, Mormon was sober of mind and “quick to observe” (Mormon 1:2). Among book of Mormon personalities, he appears to have been extremely faithful to Christ. But to what degree would contemporary Bible-based Christians recognize Mormon as a prophetic figure? And would today's Latter-day Saints recognize Mormon as a prophetic leader when his writings differ from today's understanding of certain doctrinal points? Using the Bible and literature unique to the LDS Church, this paper will examine eight dimensions of these important questions.

Smith, Bryan Cottle"	"""The Great Spirit Has Told Us That You Are the Man"": American Indian Delegations to Joseph Smith at Nauvoo, Christopher C. SmithJoseph Smith as a Spiritual Egalitarian, Bryan CottleSmith: In 1843 and 1844, several anti-American, formerly British-allied Indian groups dispatched delegations to Joseph Smith at Nauvoo. They apparently came to Smith because the exit of the British and the fall of the Shawnee prophet Tenskwatawa had left a political and religious power vacuum that they hoped Smith and his Nauvoo legion could fill. They hoped that Smith would replace the British king as their white patron and military ally and Tenskwatawa as their apocalyptic warrior-prophet. If smith had said ""yes"" to these Indian overtures, then in one fell swoop, he might have inherited the remains of Britain's and Tenskwatawa's Indian empire. He seems, however, to have turned them down, or at least to have deferred his acquiescence for public relations reasons.Cottle: Early in life, Joseph Smith experienced spiritual manifestations. For the rest of his days, he constantly urged his followers to experience the supernatural as he did. This trend reveals Joseph Smith as a ""spiritual egalitarian."" Smith also embedded his spiritual egalitarianism in the structure and teachings of his movement. Although, it can be argued, this egalitarian impulse diminished after Smith’s death in 1844, its impact upon Mormonism was profound and gives us greater insight into smith’s personality."

Are these films indicative of a spiritual renaissance in society, or are they in part an outgrowth of the spiritual lives and values of the people making them? Recent films such as The Blind Side and The Book of Eli have portrayed religious characters with depth and respect, rather than making them a curiosity or punch line. Films about religious themes and spiritual journeys can be fascinating—if the project is in the right hands. What’s needed to make a spiritually-themed film a great film, too? What makes films with spiritual themes rise above preachiness and treacle? Can filmmakers, producers, actors, and other industry players translate personal spiritual values into the film projects they undertake?

Often people accomplish this by adopting or co-opting existing expressions, trying them on for size, and changing them as the prevailing fashions of thought and expression rotate. LDS doctrine emphasizes the development of individual efforts to seek a relationship with God and all things divine. As a result of the cultural strength of individual discipleship in the Mormon experience, standardized expressions may not satisfy.

How might we move forward from what Eugene England taught in order to achieve greater academic freedom today?"

Whether it is Neal A. Maxwell citing C. S. Lewis, Boyd K. Packer quoting a poem from Best-Loved Poems of the LDS People, or President Monson invoking Abraham Lincoln, the time-honored practice helps clarify thoughts, extend arguments, and provide authority and credibility. Contemporary literary theory even reminds us that the citation is inevitable, for “grafting” another text is inherent in any use of language. Given how often LDS authors quote other writers, I explore the effect of these literary borrowings in an LDS context, examining how citing another’s text generates, expands, and multiplies meaning as well as distorts, limits, and re-interprets the original source text."

I use three foci of comparison. First, I explore ways Mormonism and early Islam seek to control the telling of history. Second, I will explore similarities in the rift between Sunni and Shi'a playing out today and the more peaceful schism of the Utah Saints and RLDS/Community of Christ. Finally, I focus on the differences between a movement that began in the desert and swiftly moved to take political control of older seats of power, and a movement that was forced from seats of power and sought refuge in the desert."

His efforts met with resistance from some Saints, which mushroomed into outright rebellion from others. When the Kirtland Safety Society began to fail, intense anger and opposition began to mount against the prophet. Many asked, “How much control should a spiritual leader have over financial matters?” This presentation examines the psychological impact of Joseph Smith's role in managing the Church's money and how this fact may have contributed to the intense opposition he experienced in 1836 and 1837."

PETERSEN	"The idea of a War in Heaven is rooted in the biblical story of fallen angels (Genesis 6), a reinterpretation of Isaiah 12, and the apocalyptic writings of John (Revelation 12). Developed in the literature of post-biblical Judaism, the idea is more fully expanded in Christianity. Mormon scripture—the Book of Moses and the Doctrine and Covenants—transforms the War into a conflict of ideas about salvation: Satan attempting to prohibit agency and guarantee universal salvation; Christ allowing choice but providing atonement for sin. In Mormon thought, the War in Heaven has been used to convey moral messages about the correct use of agency, to tie Church history to future prophetic events of cosmic history, and, most interesting, to convey an allegory about the origins of inequality and the proper role of government. Significantly, this narrative of premortal ideological confrontation also becomes a tool for earthly, political debate."

The lust (for both sex and violence) it arouses, the lust it feels, the way pain makes her feel alive and close to Edward and is therefore enjoyed, the human fragility she must overcome, the bloodlust she feels as a vampire–these elements of physicality drive the story. But just as the saga avoids explicit discussions of sex despite an emphasis on erotic desire, it also avoids explicit discussions of what physicality means. Bella’s ways of inhabiting and relating to her body reveal much about her character and about the cultures–both Mormon and western–that produced her. What do they tell us about a spiritual self?"

Arrington: A Historian's Life and Polly Aird’s book about Peter McAuslan entitled Mormon Convert, Mormon Defector: A Scottish Immigrant in the American West, 1848-1861. Through the publication of his groundbreaking Great Basin Kingdom: An Economic History of the Latter-day Saints and numerous other works, Leonard Arrington established the dominant interpretation of the Mormon experience. Yet until now, there has been little analysis of his contribution to Western history. Gary Topping re-examines Arrington’s role in founding and promoting what is known as the New Mormon History. Arrington has been criticized for relying on the assistance of staff members in the Church’s history division, but Topping shows that this collaborative approach is in keeping with the cooperative spirit of Mormonism. Polly Aird’s biography describes Peter McAuslan’s conversion to Mormonism in 1848 and journey to Utah in 1854. In the next four years, the Mormons experienced natural disasters, the Mormon Reformation, the handcart disasters, the Mountain Meadows Massacre, and the Utah War. These events and the insistence on absolute obedience to Church leaders tore at McAuslan's faith. In 1859, he and other members of his extended family applied for an army escort out of Utah. In spite of abandoning the faith he once loved, McAuslan never lost his regard for the Mormon people."

JEFF BURTON, JOHN DEHLIN"	"I will give a short presentation about a few not-yet-published Borderlanders' stories and discuss issues associated with life in the LDS Borderlands today. As in past Borderland sessions, after the main presentation, we invite audience members to ask questions of the presenters and, for those so inclined, to share stories of how you (and/or a loved one) have coped (or failed to cope) with Borderland issues and what being a “Borderlander” has meant to you and to your family and friends. By using a positive, non-blaming and non-critical approach, we can learn from your experiences and better cope ourselves. It might also help those in the closet to twist the doorknob and come out more fully into the warming lights of honesty and peace of mind."

Few could afford the printed media, nor did they have much training in discussing topics as personal as belief or as sensitive as religious history, and they feared criticism if they tried. Hence, Francophone Mormons remained virtually silent until the Internet became more accessible to them. This paper will explore Mormon Francophone participation in and production of websites, blogs, and virtual discussion groups to present their beliefs and engage in constructive dialogues with each other and with non-Mormons."

He claimed to be acting under angelic direction and produced a new scripture, the Book of Jeraneck, to usher in his new faith. Gill claims to have restored the Mormon movement which Joseph Smith founded as a restoration of the church Jesus organized but which Gill claims has fallen into apostasy– particularly its primary iteration, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), which Gill was raised in but abandoned. This paper points out ways Gill draws upon the Mormon tradition to claim authority for his new church but also the ways he seeks to alter the balance between the LDS Church and the culture around it. In particular, I explore Gill's founding narrative, comparing the language, motifs, and forms of spirituality in the Book of Jeraneck with Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon."

Panelists will discuss the new website, photos, the Eugene England papers at the University of Utah’s Marriott Library, and draw on journals and correspondence to explore and give context to two key events in his life: his mission with his wife, Charlotte, to Samoa and the infamous 1981 letter from Elder Bruce R.

ROOS, CHRISTOPHER BLYTHE, CHRISTINE BLYTHE"	"This panel presents three case studies documenting and analyzing the expressions of Utah Mormonism as they developed in the twentieth century. Through these case studies, the presenters will demonstrate the diverse schismatic response to well-documented theological and cultural change within the LDS Church. Unlike Mormon Fundamentalism, (e.g. the FLDS Church, the Apostolic United Brethren), these two movements have rarely been studied by modern academics. The Order of Aaron, the subject of the first paper, has not received scholarly attention since Hans Baer’s Recreating Utopia in the Desert in 1968. The subject of papers two and three, the Church of the Firstborn, has never been the focus of an academic study. This panel takes the audience through the rise, development, and disintegration of these religious communities, and each speaker will address why one expression of the Restoration may survive and thrive while others last only a few years."

The panelists, who are editors of and/or contributors to the project, will discuss the personal and professional reasons behind the book’s creation. Michael Austin will read a part of his chapter, which discusses how the HBO series Big Love uses polygamy to comment on contemporary American notions of the family. Mark Decker’s presentation places Peculiar Portrayals in the context of broader questions about the depiction of ethnicity in American narrative.

This panel will consider the relationship of both the masculine and the feminine and women and men in the LDS Church. Are feminine and masculine principles, values, and perspectives balanced in Church teachings and structures? Does the Church encourage and provide resources for the spiritual development of both men and women? Do men and women receive equal opportunities to develop their talents and serve in the Church? Do the governing structures of the Church reflect and work toward wholeness, balance, and inclusiveness?"

Physical objects and details assume an almost holy importance: A bottle of vitamins (Centrum Silver for Women), a jar of peanut butter, a container of ashes, inheritance documents, a flask of wine, plastic soldiers, frozen elk parts, a pair of shorts worn underneath a Sunday dress. “Boss of all bosses of the universe.../ Go ahead, shuffle your zeros tonight./ Dip in ink the comets' tails./ Staple the night with starlight.” (Charles Simic)"	SL10135	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL10135.mp3																				SL10151: Line Upon Line: How the New Personal Progress/Duty to God Programs Are Defining Tomorrow's Leaders	"LAURA COMPTON, TRESA EDMUNDS"	"I compare and contrast the new Personal Progress/Duty to God programs and discuss how the requirements, suggested goals, and reading assignments are similar/different for girls and boys. I will also explore how the Proclamation on the Family has been integrated into the Primary program, discuss what seems to be the most-quoted portion of the Proclamation, and examine the possible ramifications based on the rather narrow way it is quoted/used in Primary/Young Men/Young Women."

PARKER BLOUNT	"The LDS Church has released a guide for journalists titled Approaching Mormon History. The document acknowledges that some journalists “have questioned the miraculous aspects of the faith” and wonder “why Latter-day Saints continue to believe them as reality and not myths.” The document argues for the historical reality of the Mormon foundational stories, namely the Joseph Smith story. They are of value, the document tells us, because they “actually happened,” and not for any “symbolic” value. In this presentation, I will look at the mythological themes in the First Vision story and suggest that in the effort to celebrate and glamorize it, the story has become more mythological than literal history."

The Netherlands and Belgium have passed even broader laws allowing assisted suicide and limited euthanasia. These trends reflect an evolution in medical technology and culture surrounding death though they generate controversy about the meaning and significance of active control over the timing of one's death.

The Newtonian worldview orients all of our cultural thinking, and the Church has fully embraced its values. In this paradigm, the ego can use the notion of truth to self-aggrandize. A compelling invitation to wake up from both the paradigm trances of our ego and cultural truth is needed. Truth and reality begin to look different when we are no longer held hostage to their spell. When we awaken, the Church's narrative of history/ideology can take on new philosophical meaning while providing alternative options of faith."

Marriage, Embodiment, and Salvation"	JANICE ALLRED	"The relationship between faith and works provides the framework for much theological reflection on the Christian doctrine of salvation. Although Mormon writers address salvation from this perspective, they usually do so in dialogue with the larger Christian community. Within contemporary Mormonism, discourse about salvation tends to focus on teachings about eternal marriage and the eternal family. A Mormon is more likely to ask “Will I reach the celestial kingdom?” than “Am I saved?” Can the Mormon view of eternal marriage be harmonized with scriptural texts on salvation? Is temple marriage required for exaltation in the celestial kingdom?"

This presentation examines the principles and doctrines of the Latter-day gospel that support and promote such a rich and spiritual experience.

PETERSEN	"In 1838, Joseph Smith proclaimed Spring Hill in Daviess County, Missouri, as Adam-ondi-Ahman, the place where eventually Adam “shall come to visit his people” (D&C 116). He had already established the idea of Adam-ondi-Ahman as the land into which Adam and Eve were exiled and where Adam gave his final blessing to his children. Tied into Book of Mormon revelations declaring this land “choice above all other lands” (Ether 2:9–10), these ideas integrated religious past with prophetic future, uniting sacred time with sacred space and bringing the natural world into a cosmic order. In this paper, I place Joseph Smith’s ideas about “spiritual creation” and the land of Zion into historical context and explore the evolution of these ideas in Mormon thought."

What cultural tendencies does it reflect? What does the evolution of this tale reveal about the changing nature of Mormon folklore, theology, culture, and daily life? The story is long, convoluted, and fascinating. It features the Apostle Paul, Eliza R. Snow, Joseph Fielding Smith, and Spencer W. Kimball; it begins in 1833 and is still evolving today. We'll touch on demonic possession, the Three Nephites, Yeti sightings in Weber County, and Heber Kimball's experiences in the British mission.

How do we as Mormons include people with disabilities, mental illness, or other vulnerabilities as equal members within the body of Christ?

Divorce, addiction, abuse, disability–they happen to the best of us no matter how righteous we are, and many of us feel the impulse to hide tragedy in our lives.

Our panelists, several of whom have been excommunicated, will explore the theological and spiritual ramifications of this ultimate Church sanction. Why does excommunication not require a ritual? If blessings are “restored” to an excommunicated person who returns to the Church, what became of those blessings in the interim? Is it reasonable that God would give fallible human leaders the power to separate people from him or their families in eternity?

If it becomes preoccupied with the patriarchal nature of the Church, it can fail to do its most necessary work: to meet the spiritual, emotional, and social needs of LDS women. This session explores how patriarchy operates in male-dominated organizations in general and in the Church in particular, especially since the advent of Correlation; examines problems this creates for Relief Society members; and offers suggestions for how Relief Society can better meet the needs of LDS women."

This session examines the dimensions of a mature Christian/Mormon discipleship, including responsible doubt, blind obedience, institutional loyalty, thoughtful non-conformity, and loving challenge to authority. It considers the challenges, complexities, and conundrums of what it means to be obedient both to the principles of Christ’s gospel and the demands of a conservative faith community while seeking the sacred in a secular world.

Packer has established himself as simultaneously a revealer and keeper of secrets: an expounder of revealed truth who broaches topics not often discussed, but at the same time is emphatic about leaving certain things unspoken in the name of protecting the sacred. Using Douglas Davies’s notion of sacred secrecy, I analyze four categories of “secrets” in the teachings of President Packer—the unwritten, the unsuitable, the confidential, and the sacred—and show how these categories serve to draw boundaries and reinforce apostolic charisma."

Few people have had more reason to leave Mormonism than William H. Chamberlin. He was one of the first Mormons to do formal studies in philosophy and biblical criticism and ended up blacklisted from teaching for Church Education after the 1911 modernism controversy at BYU. Harvard colleagues suggested Chamberlin seek a position outside of Utah, but he refused to consider it: """"I had never thought of it; but for me it would be quite impossible. If I cannot live in the mountains and work among the people I love, it may as well be all over."""" Chamberlin not only stayed in the culture, he also stayed in the Church despite opposition he faced in the Church education system. Chamberlin’s life and idea of truth suggest ways to think about the truth of religion in general and Mormonism in particular."

Rachel Ann Nunes is a Utah housewife and mother of six in tandem with her successful novel-writing career. Her four novels of the Ariana series from the 1990s are romantic and family sagas about LDS Church members in their native France struggling with the challenges of late twentieth-century life.

SMITH	"It is well known that the 1835 D&C substituted ancient-sounding """"code names"""" for the names of nineteenth-century persons and institutions associated with the """"United Firm."""" The recent publication of original handwritten manuscripts for these revelations reveals that the code names were the tip of the iceberg. Significant additions and deletions were made in order to make these revelations appear to be ancient documents from the time of Enoch. New evidence of a more thoroughgoing fictionalization not only raises the theological question of “inspired fiction” but also provides a striking example of how Joseph Smith blended mystical and practical concerns. He sought to maintain secrecy by mystically identifying the Firm and the Kirtland brethren with the ancient Adamic order."

Our goal is to shift the perspective of LGBT equality from a place of “problem” to “solution,” from a scriptural argument to a religious liberty agreement, and to address the issue of equality as informed by the U.S. Constitution."

After seeing a clip from the film, panelists will address the following questions: Can the film be classified as anti-Mormon propaganda? What are the film’s strengths and weaknesses? What is its likely impact on the same-sex marriage debate and the LDS Church’s treatment of gays and lesbians? What is the likely effect of the film on the Church’s public image?

One Small Cow	"TRENT D. STEPHENS, KEVIN HOLDSWORTH"	"When any disaster occurs, people look somewhere to place blame. In a maturing society, the better approach is to examine the data objectively. When this approach is applied to the Willie and Martin handcart disaster, two major problems emerge for the companies: one was the late start, and the other was inadequate food supplies. The former problem seems to have been exacerbated by the ending of the Crimean War, and the latter was exacerbated by more military mouths to feed at Fort Laramie because of an incident a year earlier involving one small cow."

Through an exploration of texts, inscriptions, and frescoes from the earliest Christianity, the author reaches back even farther into history to show that women once served as apostles, elders, deacons, and bishops in addition to performing baptisms and administering the Eucharist."

In response, Madson outlines a framework for analyzing when, if ever, war is justified, suggesting that the Book of Mormon not only allows for but strongly promotes pacifism. Van Wagenen outlines evidence that the Book of Mormon does allow for war, but only under well-prescribed conditions, namely in self-defense against aggressors or in rebellion against a government/ruler that requires its subjects to engage in acts of aggression. Both authors contend that the Afghanistan war does not meet the requirements of either a pacifist or defensive war and therefore should not be supported"	SL10262	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL10262.mp3																				SL10263: In Memoriam	"ANNE WILDE, BEVERLY HOPPE, KAREN ROSENBAUM, DOUGLASS TABER"	Sunstone lost a number of dear friends in the past year.

MICHAEL QUINN"	"In 1838 Missouri, certain Mormons organized in a secret paramilitary organization called the Danites, led by Sampson Avard, who later left the Church. Many Mormons then disavowed the Danite movement, portraying it as lies concocted by Avard. When Leland Gentry wrote his groundbreaking 1965 thesis about the 1838 Mormon War, however, he reported that irrefutable evidence showed loyal Mormons had been involved in the group. One crucial issue at stake is the question of whether Joseph Smith was involved in the Danite movement. He certainly attended Danite meetings and possibly knew Danite passwords, though the evidence for this from Luman Shurtliff’s diary is ambiguous."

Both Nietzsche and Mormonism have strong replies to these limitations and exalt the potential for human growth. By comparing and contrasting Nietzsche’s concept of the will to power and Mormonism’s exaltation, we gain insight into the nature of power and its relation to individuals. While Nietzsche emphasizes the unbounded individual, Mormonism argues the greatest human potential is cultivated by persons bonded through covenant to God and family."

Dissatisfied members of an organization, business, or nation have a variety of choices available, including both exit (simply leaving) and voice (discussing their dissatisfaction). As Hirschman notes, greater loyalty to the organization can correspond to greater use of voice. Contradicting traditional Mormon views, dissent may actually indicate greater loyalty to the organization than does silent acquiescence. Panelists will discuss loyalty, voice, exit, and dissent from a variety of angles, ultimately suggesting that the LDS understanding of public disagreement may be underdeveloped, and sketching ways in which legitimate dissent could take on a broader role in the LDS community."

SCHERER"	"""Finally, Decentralization . . . I Think: The Community of Christ World Conference of 2010."" The revelations of Joseph Smith established a hierarchical church organization (i.e. revelations come only through the prophet, and a hierarchical priesthood structure). Members of Latter-Day Saint church organizations in democratic countries often feel frustrated at the lack of democracy in their church, with legislative, executive, and judicial powers concentrated at the top. In the RLDS Church (since 2001 the Community of Christ) in time of tension, there has been a natural tendency to centralize power. In 1966, the Council of Twelve announced five objectives for the church, one of which was to decentralize. But the church is more centralized today than it was at that time. At the April World Conference 2010, the vexing issue of homosexuality (same-sex marriage, priesthood availability) led President Veazey to decentralize decision-making (Doctrine and Covenants 164, 2010). Time will tell whether decentralization will actually occur. ""Transforming Human Relationships in a Divided World: A Historian’s View of Community of Christ’s Section 164."" President Stephen M. Veazey’s inspired document was approved by delegates at the Community of Christ’s 2010 World Conference and became Section 164 in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants. Future historians may see the impact of this prophetic message on today’s church as similar to the way Sections 17 (LDS 20) and 104 (LDS 107) shaped the Restoration. Lacking the poetic language in previous Words of Counsel, Section 164 establishes administrative guidelines that will frame church polity and discourse for generations to come. In the future, the Conference of 2010 may well be seen as the Community of Christ’s Vatican II moment. This paper discusses the impact of Section 164, past, present, and future."

Is dissent praying privately to Mother in Heaven? Is it not putting up a lawn sign supporting Prop 8? Is it splitting your Boy Scout donation so that the Young Women get half? What role has dissent played in the Church in the last 20 years? Has it been good for the Church? Good for dissenters? Two bookends for this discussion will be the speculative theology represented by Strangers in Paradox, published 20 years ago, and the Gospel Essentials manual, now curriculum for Relief Societies and Melchizedek Priesthood quorums. “Defecting in Place.” I remain active in my ward while defining my beliefs differently from most orthodox LDS Church members. I have adopted the stance of “defecting in place,” or dissenting while staying. Based on my most recent temple recommend interview, I examine some of the areas of tension, shared expectations, and teaching/learning moments that move the experience from hostile interrogation, ritual compliance, or personal soul-searching into community-building between leader and member. In a setting where the handbook assumes that one person has all the questions and the other person has all the answers, what happens to areas of dissent?

This bifurcation persists because of the intensity of the tension gay and lesbian Mormons experience between Church authority and personal experience seemingly at odds with that authority.

According to LDS doctrine at least through the 1960s, we are not only stewards of the earth but co-creators with God. Brigham Young taught that the roles God gives human beings are designed to test them, enabling them to show to themselves, to their fellow human beings, and to God just how they would act if entrusted with God’s power.

The identity of the denomination was based on “right belief this approach changed very little over the first century of the Reorganization (1850s to 1950s). I show why the Community of Christ no longer concerns itself with concepts of “only,” “legitimate,” or “true.” Seeing God’s power active in all places, with all people, at all times, the denomination now identifies with discipleship as a way of life modeled on the life and ministry of Jesus Christ.

"”Toeing the Line: Is the LDS Church a Moral Agent or a Political Machine?” The LDS Church identifies its involvement in same-sex marriage issues as a moral cooperative with other religions. Yet participation by both members and general leaders appears to have outweighed participation by other religious adherents. Has the Church crossed the line from moral organizer to political action committee? Is there a difference between the two? Let's examine the evidence from 50 years of trials, proclamations, memos, experiences, and hearings—and figure out which side of the line we're on. “Mobilizing For Marriage: Congregations and Arizona’s Proposition 102.” On 4 November 2008, Arizona citizens passed Proposition 102. This proposition—known by its supporters as the Marriage Protection Amendment—amended the Arizona state constitution to define marriage as a relationship only between one man and one woman. Drawing on the Southern Arizona Congregations Study (a representative survey of 297 congregations in southern Arizona collected in 2009), I present findings related to congregation-based support of and opposition to Proposition 102 and discuss the peculiarity of Mormon participation in relation to that of other faiths. Mormon congregations were by far the most likely to get involved and participate at high levels of political mobilization in support of the proposition.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Tolstoyans are similar in that both groups have histories of oppression, resilience, and a love for peace, music, and community. “The Mormon Mother and Subsistence Eco-feminism” For many women, the tension between Mormonism and feminism feels like a battle between a paycheck and a family: feminists tell us to take our place as equals with men while Mormon leaders instruct us to be wives and mothers, contending that ‘career women’ lead unfulfilling lives, repress their ability to nurture and overlook meaningful relationships. I believe Mormonism’s emphasis on traditional women's roles is useful in a radical critique of patriarchy. A true focus on maternal nurturing demands rejection of exploitative capitalism, warfare, environmental destruction, and obedience to male, high-status leaders. “Kinship Structures.” The tradition of universal kinship in Mormon thought constitutes a powerful and relatively untapped form of transnational Alternative Civil Society that can resist state efforts to separate us by ethnicity, class, or nationality. This is not automatic: it requires a re-shaping and an elaboration (a “magnification”) of Mormon doctrines of genealogy, universal divine descent, and fundamental human equality. Though genealogy might suggest an exclusivity of family ties, understanding it in the context of Mormon doctrines of universal siblinghood provides a useful and flexible toolbox of concepts for egalitarian revolution. “Plotino Constantino Rhodakanaty and the beginnings of Mexican Mormonism.” Little is known about Dr. Plotino Constantino Rhodakanaty’s early years and virtually nothing of his life after 14 May 1886 when he vanished. However, his influence in the Mexican socialist and anarchist tradition and his influence in bringing the restored gospel of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to Mexico are of great interest to many. This paper discusses Rhodakanaty’s marriage and his son, Nefi, as well as his relationship with Meltion Gonzalez Trejo, John Taylor, and L. A. Bertand in Paris, France, and what might have happened to Rhodakanaty after 1886."	SL10335	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL10335.mp3																				SL10355: The Mormon Bibles	"WILLIAM D. RUSSELL, KIM MCCALL"	"The King James Version of the Bible (1611) is the official Bible for the LDS Church while the RLDS Church has adopted the Joseph Smith Translation, published by the Reorganization in 1867, as its official Bible. Kim McCall will present a paper on the KJV, and William D. Russell will present a paper evaluating the JST, which came to be called “The Inspired Version” by the RLDS Church (now called the Community of Christ).

Yet, many tensions remain and likely will not be resolved. This presentation will look at these common themes and tensions from the perspective of an LDS scholar who is also an advocate of liberal social justice."

MCLEMORE	"In Matthew 23 and Luke 11, Jesus lambasted the religious leaders of his day for blatant hypocrisy and a style of spiritual leadership that took away “the key of knowledge” and “shut up the kingdom of heaven against men.” According to Jesus, not only did this prevent the leaders themselves from entering the kingdom but it also “hindered” those who were close to entering! Although I don’t believe the modern LDS Church is guilty of the egregious hypocrisy detailed by Jesus, I am concerned it has established a similar system of status and worthiness along with external religious practices that can impede Latter-day Saints from the spiritual understandings and disciplines that lead to spiritual rebirth and open the kingdom of heaven. This presentation explores whether modern LDS culture and religious practices reflect the spiritual leadership that Jesus embodied or the leadership of those he criticized for hindering."

MICHAEL QUINN"	"Masonic, magic, and religious lore regarding the rod of Aaron simmered in the burned-over district during the Second Great Awakening. Oliver Cowdery had already received revelations through a rod before meeting Joseph Smith, who revealed that Oliver would translate ancient texts just as Joseph had with seer stones. When the Joseph Smith Papers Project published A Book of Commandments and Revelations, an earlier version of the rod of nature revelation became available for analysis. Adding to two extant versions, the new copy included handwritten modifications, providing essentially four versions of this revelation for analysis. A look at the historical backgrounds of the Smith and Cowdery families, coupled with the revelatory context of D&C 8, tells a compelling story."

How were so many of us persuaded that we can experience the spiritual but not measure it, or that we can promote such experience but not manage it with greater precision? When did we convince ourselves that machines must be cold metal and hollow plastic, forever in contrast to the warmth and beauty of the human soul? Can technology and spirit be brought together?"

However, for his trilogy bash, he relied on stories written centuries earlier by the dramatist Euripides. LaBute updated the stories, placing them in roughly contemporary time and a Mormon setting.

Mormon Fiction and America	"ELBERT EUGENE PECK, JANE BARNES, KAREN ROSENBAUM, ELLEN FAGG WEIST, STEVE WILLIAMS"	"As a non-Mormon writer for the PBS film, The Mormons, Jane Barnes found no novels about the Saints' place in America. Her paper “Notes Toward a New Mormon Fiction,” asks questions about this absence, starting with the whereabouts of a Mormon Sound and Fury or My Antonia. How can Mormon writers look at their experience with the same broad perspective as do William Faulkner, Willa Cather, or even Harriet Beecher Stowe? Should they try? Does the Church inhibit them? What are some of the major themes connected to the Mormon story as it comments on the larger American narrative? Moderator Elbert Peck offers his own brief speculations on why an earlier period of Mormon-American authors “seemed really on the verge of being part of the national conversation, but then that blossoming died.” Other writers on the panel will respond to Barnes’ paper by describing how they deal with–or see no reason for dealing with–the national context in their own work."

THOMAS, MARGARET TOSCANO, PAUL TOSCANO"	"Twenty years ago, Margaret and Paul Toscano published Strangers in Paradox: Explorations in Mormon Theology. Fascinated by the richness of Mormon texts and ritual, they had been working out a complex theology for twenty years and were eager to share their insights. The book immediately became a feminist sensation and an official scandal, resulting—at least indirectly—in the authors' excommunications in 1993 and 2000. On the anniversary of its publication, it seems appropriate to take a retrospective and prospective look at Strangers in Paradox. They will explore: What contributions does this book make to Mormon theology? Does its unifying theme of paradox illuminate and unify disparate aspects of Mormon thought? How effective is its rhetorical stance and style in conveying its meaning? How has it been received? What influence will it have in the future?"

An engagement with these narratives has the potential to transform not only the way we see the world but our very identity.

During the past half-century, an important shift occurred in the study of history. Influenced by the Civil Rights and the Women’s Liberation movements, scholars moved beyond simply studying the written documents of the educated and famous. Within religious history, the focus of research became the practices of the people rather than the ideas of the elite.In order to get at this ""underside of history,"" scholars looked beyond the written word to the world of things and spaces. Material culture studies evolved to pull information out of objects, art, landscapes, and architecture. How does an ordinary object become holy, sacred, special?What are some of the ways that Christians have manipulated the material world to create and maintain their spiritual visions? How does material culture function within religious communities? Why are Americans, in particular, wedded to the physical expressions of their faith? This lecture will provide a theoretical foundation for addressing Mormon religious practices by using material culture."

Georgia Platts	"This presentation considers why, along with otherunderprivileged groups, Mormon women so oftenfight against their own interests. The answeremerges from sociological theory, which explainsthat society ends up shaping the very thoughts inour minds so that the world as it is seems naturaland normal, the end result being that many of usaccept it without question. in particular, the belief That God wants inequality strengthens adherence to inequality."

Surprisingly, Mormonism exhibits some strong elements of what people might consider “ancestor worship.” From an anthropological point of view, I will explore how Mormonism challenges our traditional notions of both kinship and ancestral worship; I will also consider important ethical implications. Blurring the definition of kinship and expanding the view of ancestors by imagining all people as our brothers and sisters can help shape ethical codes by creating a level of responsibility and respect between those we don’t even know. It’s difficult to shirk responsibility and ignore other people’s needs, whether dead or alive, if we imagine them as our own siblings."

His most interesting teaching is that the earth is round—but it’s also hollow, and we’re on the inside. It’s a strange belief now, but in the 1880s...it was plausible. However, as sciences advanced, Koresh’s hollow world began to implode. The histories of Koreshanity and Mormonism follow a parallel course to the martyrdom of their prophets and beyond."

On the street, a scruffy man pushing a loaded shopping cart asks for your spare change. What do you do? Do you give? Do you ignore? Do you reflect, 'I donated at Christmas time…isn’t that enough?’ Many of us encounter the dispossessed and become ethically or spiritually uneasy, not knowing how best to help. What really improves the lives of those without homes? Join me for some answers, and become a part of this discussion."

Mormons normally offer trite explanationsfor this story or dismiss it completely as ludicrous.How are we to productively interpret a seeminglyabsurd scripture passage like this in ways thatare not simplistic, insensitive, incredible, orobscene?"

Joseph Smith re-established the one true Christian church, and l. Ron Hubbard’s techniques of dianetics and Scientology put forth a spiritual view of humans that challenged the materialism of modern psychology and psychiatry. This presentation offers a comparative analysis and critique of recent marketing efforts by both churches to introduce thepublic to ordinary Mormons and Scientologists via the “i am a Mormon” (httP://mormon.org/PeoPle/) and “i am a Scientologist” (httP://www.SCientology.org/) campaigns"	SL11151	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL11151.mp3																				"""Prophet"" As Artifact And Material Culture"	Steven L. Shields	"This paper considers the experiences, ministry, prophetic work, and church groups started by three different but related twentieth-century prophets in lesser-known Latter Day Saint denominations. Otto Fetting, Thomas B. Nerren,and William A. Draves each claimed and produced messages reportedly given by a resurrected John the Baptist. None claimed to be “a prophet,” nor did their respective church organizations institutionalize a person or office of “prophet.” However, each functioned in the prophetic role, and with the death of each, the messages ceased and the original church groups foundered. Latter Day Saint church groups that have prospered, on the other hand, tended to focus on the prophetic office, as distinct from the person and any reported messages, often institutionalizing the “prophet” as both spiritual and administrative leader. As both artifact and material culture, “prophet” is an essential ingredient of the Latter Day Saint movement and is central to the community of the church."

We must strive to live as responsible stewards, making prudent use of resources, cultivating abundance in our own spheres of influence to provide for our families and to bless others.

This reaction to the nuts-and-bolts of child-rearing and homemaking reveals the truemisogyny behind the pretty flattery.

Beliefs about gender are embodied in the physical objects, resources, spaces, and structures which Mormons create and use to carry out the work and life of the Church. Mormon material culture not only reflects gender beliefs but also influences the ways in which gender is perceived. This panel will explore the many waysin which gender shapes and is shaped by the Church's material culture.

"Doe Daughtrey, Nadine Hansen, Jana Riess, Dan Wotherspoon"	"The song ""I Believe"" from the Tony award-winning musical The Book of Mormon mentions familiar, obscure, and even contested Mormon doctrines. This panel is a riff of sorts on ideas enumerated in the song, from the foundationalbelief that God created the universe and sent his son to die for our sins to the idea that God speaks directly to the president of the Church and has a plan for us that includes our getting our own planets.

How did the utah Supreme Court favor the Church and its leaders? What was Heber C. kimball’s son doing on the Joe Hill jury? Why did an impressive anti-Mormon rant get Joe Hill’s lawyer disbarred?

However, it is a mistake to equate all democratic religion with populist religion, as Hatch does. Dissenters from the Mormons and Methodists used the populists’ own democratic rhetoric against them, even though they tended to be respectable bourgeois liberalsinstead of the down-on-their-luck populists Hatch atalogues. The bourgeois dissenters and Hatch's rough-and-ready populists were equally committed to democracy, but the two groups interpreted it differently.

Experiences of wonder spark both intense religious experiences and profound relationship connections. in both arenas—the intimately spiritual and the intimately social—when we are stunned, dazed, breathtaken, overwhelmed, consumed, or astonished, we feel yearnings to explore, to understand, to receive. What we receive (while wondering) will exceed the boundaries of our previous understanding, stimulating creative patterns of connection to God, loved ones, and the world. This session will explore the ways we often pursue stability at the expense of wonder, closing ourselves off to God and to each other. it will also invite us to remain open to the sparks of wonder in intimate relationships, our relationship with religion, and our relationship with God."

As chief legal adviser in the US State Department, he even wanted to jail all pacifists.Despite this background, he played a different role in Mormon leadership circles by becoming a puzzling and strident anti-militarist, anti-interventionist, and pro-pacifist from 1933 to his death in 1961.

The gift appears again in the Book of Mormon. It should be no surprise that when Joseph Smith proclaimed the estoration of the primitive church, expectations for the estored gift were soon followed by rumors of its appearance and later outright manifestations. This paperconsiders the phenomenon of raising the dead in the larger context of the antebellum Protestant debate about the possibility of miracles; it will consider reports in early Mormonism and explore ways that Mormon experience, doctrine, and authority have explained the phenomenon, using it to illuminate changing Mormon understandingsof the nature of the miracle itself."

When Gene participated in the founding of Dialogue, elder Joseph Fielding Smith said it would not be good for the Church. And Gene's essays and sermons were as troubling to some as the scholarly journal he began was to elder Smith. However, those who knew Gene would add a caveat that however inspiring or troubling his words, he was even more interesting and difficult to know. Whatever Eugene England's legacy and influence on Mormons andMormonism, his influence—on the people who knew him—was greater.

This idea in Platonic philosophy and its emphasis in Christian Platonism always accompanies a story of a fall from perfect unity in the ideal and a return to the same unity at the end of time. But Givens doesn’t see that for nineteenth-century Romantics and Idealists, this cycle of alienation and return assumes an even more dramatic character as the alienation of the individual from the absolute and her eventual return is the creation of a new and greater unity than the original; thus the final unity is also a plurality of persons.

Special emphasis will be given to the strengths versus the weaknesses of each, as well as assessingthe chances for success of each. A brief overview will be provided of the nine candidates with Mormon ties (beginning with Joseph Smith in 1844) who preceded Romney and Huntsman in seeking the presidency.

Women's myriad obligations to family and home fall under the category of ""homemaking,"" a weighty term expressing all sorts of expectations about how women should behave and feel as they make a home for others. interest in “homemaking” continues, though today it is often shaped by difficult economic realities, environmental and commercial concerns, shifts in what society accepts as the definition of a family, and a general fear about a decline in the proper stewardship of our social existence. What does it mean to make a home, and how do we all contribute to the creation of homes we want to live in?"

Reed, Clair Barrus"	"In the early nineteenth century, many prominent Freemasons sought to “Christianize” Freemasonry. Distinguished European Masonic writers promoted interpretations of Masonic rituals that were almost clusively Christian. Reverend Salem Town of New york also promoted this Christian application in his widely circulated A System of Speculative Masonry (1818),claiming that the initiate’s progression out of darkness and into the light is symbolic of the fall of adam/man and his redemption through Jesus Christ’s atoning sacrifice. I argue that Joseph Smith participated in this christianization” movement by placing Masonic ritual in the narrative context of Adam’s fall and redemption."

Cost and functional requirements now trump aesthetic and spatial concerns in these packaged products sent to wards and stakes worldwide. The presentation will show distinctive features of LDS meetinghouses around the world, review standard plan development from its inception through today, show positive and negative consequences that have resulted from these correlated designs, and ask if it is possible to build both functionaland beautiful standardized buildings."

Though given up for dead and widely reported killed, Boggs survived. Thecrime was never solved. Twenty-five years after the fact, seeking closure if not justice, his family hired a Pinkerton agent to examine the evidence and identify the assailant. From the West Coast to the banks of the Mississippi, from the Missouri River to the shores of the Great Salt lake, thedetective follows a trail that leads, inevitably, to the notorious Mormon gunfighter Porter Rockwell."

Jolley"	"In this portion of a longer memoir that examines my connections to the lives of lineal ancestors in sixteenth-century northern Germany, I draw on historical events to imagine what life would have been like for the daughter of a ferryman ancestor named Edde Feerman. Records of the time primarily document the lives of the region’s land-owning men, like those of Edde and his two sons.Still, it is likely that Edde also had a daughter, and in this section of my memoir, i tell her story—and speculate on its residue in my twenty-firstcentury life."

His religious and patriotic paintings have sold widely, and YouTube videos of two of his most popular paintings have each been seen by more than 3,000,000 viewers. But McNaughton’s art is also controversial because of the overt far-right political and religious messages it conveys.

Stevens	"When people experience disagreements or conflict,passive aggression is one of at least five possible response options. Research shows that it is generally a poor, unconstructive strategy, and is also a less common response among the US population at large. However, for Latter-Day Saints born and raised along the Wasatch Front, the passive-aggressive response appears to occur at a rate approximately two to three times higher than the national average. This paper will present data on this phenomenon along with a discussion on the most likely causal forces driving these findings."

The influence of Mormon chapels on the worship experience will be compared with architecturally created sacred spaces from other religious traditions. The design of Mormon churchbuildings and the size, placement, and furnishings of specific rooms reflect the gender bias in the Church. These architecturally reinforced prejudices frequently lead to practical problems for Primary and young Women leaders. We will discuss alternatives to chapel design that may solve these problems. We will conclude the sessionwith a slide show of Mormon chapels with unique steeples and facades."

Russell	"We all know Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. as the leading civil rights activist in America in the 1960s—a man who offered a prophetic voice to the major domestic issue of his time. But he should also be seen as one whose thought, asreflected in a significant body of public writings, reveals a man who can be rightly regarded as one of the leading Christian thinkers of twentieth-century America as well as a prophet whose message can and should be appropriated by Mormons of various perspectives. He gleaned from the best philosophical and religious thinkers of his day a new way to think about major issues and a strategy for dealing with not only racial oppression but other issues as well; thus, we should make much more use of his thinking inchurch life today"	SL11353	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL11353.mp3																				Solitary Faith	Tiffany Mull	"The paper investigates the cultural space inhabited by LDS women who remain single past the “ordinary” marrying age of their religion. Using stories and personal narratives of single LDS women, the project situates and analyzes theexperiences of the women within the broader Mormon framework. The women in the study feel out of sorts: they are caught between what their culture tells them they should be and what they actually are."

The Dead Sea Scrolls reveal that among the missing information is an ancient Israelite/Christian doctrine that yahweh was born on earth as the firstborn son of adam—first as abel and afterwardsas Seth—and that Cain was the son of the serpent. The sacrifice of Cain and Abel was an offering to be accepted by the savior of the world. Upon Cain’s rejection, he murdered his competition, after which 130 years later, yahweh was incarnate again in the person of Seth. Come hear more about these early Israelite and Christianbeliefs and what they mean to today's understanding of Biblical texts."

In 2010, the LDS Church stated its new Fourth Mission “to serve the poor and needy” in a new handbook that emphasizes ministering to others. Similar strong traditions exist in many otherChristian churches as well as in Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, and Hinduism. Yet today, loud voices within Mormonism seem to reject the spiritual values of being inclusive (Mitt Romney), social justice (Glenn Beck), and caring for immigrants (Arizona Senator Russell Pearceand the Utah legislature).

Some suggested that this kind of editing is a common occurrence with general conference talks.

Paulsen and Martin Pulido entitled ""'A Mother There': A Survey of Historical Teachings about Mother in Heaven."" The article documents statements about Heavenly Mother by Mormon leaders and demonstrates that, contrary to popular belief, Mormon doctrine does not include a prohibition on discussing her—just praying to her.What does this article, paid for and published by BYU, mean for our understanding of Heavenly Mother? What does it mean for the feminist scholars who have studied and written about her in the past? What does it mean for feminists who want to discuss her now?

Luffman, D. Michael Quinn, Michael G. Reed, Allen Roberts"	"A supremely important artifact to early Christianswas the cross; slivers of it were cherished as themost valuable of relics. Over time, the cross hasbeen repudiated by latter-day Saints, whoinstead mark their most sacred buildings with astatue of Moroni. Arguably the most important artifact ofMormonism, the object on which its existence rests, is missing. We do not have the Golden Plates, and only a dozen men claimed having seen them (a servant woman who claimed Moroni showed her the plates was never taken seriously). Valuable because of their material, their age, and their content, the Golden Plates have been replaced by a mass-produced book valuable because of its content. additional artifacts key to the Book of Mormon’s translation, the Urim and Thummim, are also missing. other artifacts and aspects of Mormon material culture were lost or abandoned as the Saints migrated from place to place. In recent years, however, some of these historical edifices have been rebuilt. A temple was constructed on the site of the first Nauvoo Temple; its exterior matches the original, though the interior doesnot. Historic kirtland is a meticulous reconstruction of a community that includes a sawmill, a store, a schoolhouse, and an inn. And while some latter-day Saints retain and cherish family heirlooms and personal items so imbued with spiritual significance—peep stones, or handkerchiefs or canes blessed with the power to heal—that they become religious artifacts, such items are increasingly sequestered in museums. What do these missing, rebuilt, repudiated, or sequestered artifacts mean to a people profoundly interested in ocumenting and preserving their material culture? How is meaning created by these objects? How do we understand the various meanings when the objects we've created are damaged by moth or rust, stolen by thieves, or lost? How does meaning shift when those objects are replaced by something else—leatherbound and gilt-edged Books of Mormon replacing the Golden Plates, for instance, or a modern LDS temple built on the site of a much older and very different building? How do these treasures of heaven on earth help us understand both heaven and earth?"	SL11371	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL11371.mp3																				The Prodigal Sun	Carol B.

Reed	"Hugh Nibley declared, ""[T]he knowledge and use of mental plates for the keeping of important records is beginning to emerge…. It will not be long before men forget that in Joseph Smith's day the prophet was mocked and derided for his description of the plates more than anything else."" Lehi in the Desert, 107. Contrary to what Nibley implies, Joseph's critics generally mocked him either because they associated his ""find"" with his treasure quests or they believed the plates (if made of gold) should've been heavier--not because people doubted the existance of ancient meallic records. My presentation will demonstrate that the acknowledgment of ancient metallic plates' existence was a fairly common idea in Joseph Smith's nineteenth-century environment."

Augusta was Brigham's second plural wife (of 55 total). A boston Brahmin, herbalist, and cultural feminist, Augusta abandoned her wealthy first husband and six of her children to marry Brigham Young in 1843. Her letters are replete with the details of their failing relationship. Separating Brigham the prophet from Brigham the man, Augusta found the man an uncouth, lower-class hypocrite who often unfairly chastised her, played his favorite wives against her, and on occasion even whipped her. Although she bitterly complalined, like singer Patsy Cline, the more he abused her, the more she vowed to winn back his heart. While they never divorced, Augusta did have Brigham seal her for eternity to Joseph Smith and later asked to be sealed to St. Paul and even Jesus Christ."

This paper agrees. An unquestioned, aggressively supported faith tends to dismiss logical argument and evidentiary consideration, thereby involving the abdication of one's responsibility as a thoughtful moral agent. This is a form of pride that also continues to be highly destructive in many forms outside of religion, including those of persistent tribalism and ideological extremism. This paper discusses unflinching, uncritical faith as a sin of pride, one that is indeed a stumbling block to the LDS community."

Smith	"Although Brigham Young chose not to settle in the Golden State, he tracked the pioneer journeys of Lewis and Clark. Four years before Claifornia became a state, Young commissioned Sam Brannan to sail from New York to San Francisco in 1846 with about 248 Mormons who would become part of early Californic life. Young also proposed a state of ""Deseret"" which sought to extend his Utah settlement across California to the Pacific Ocean. Allthough this proposal was unsuccessful, Brigham Young perhaps should be considered a California pioneer, since the arrival of so many early settlers resulted from his initiative."

Smith, Jenny Hedman"	"The role of women, particularly in the areas of priesthood and leadership, has changed radically over the past four decades. Section 156 of Doctrine and Covenants, given in 1984, introduced ordination of women in the denomination. The panel will analyze these changes from two different approaches: 1) the institutional and historical contexts, with emphasis on how women's priesthood and leadership has impacted imagery and activity, including perspectives on how the ordination of women is seen and interpreted in India and sub-Saharan Africa; and 2) one woman's personal experience of God and of living through the transformation and expansion of women's roles."

Similarly, a composer can 'spin' our understanding of what 'really' happened. Considering examples from centruies of Catholic and LDS art and music, we will look at how artists have left their (often subversive) mark on the historical record by influencing it, changing it, inverting it, concealing it.

Two mojor social issues, same-sex marriage and the nature of baptism, had the church's membership polarized. President/Prophet Stephen M. Veazey brought to the conference a document which became section 164 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Section 164 and the discernment process leading up to the conference brought a sense of the Holy Spirit to the gathering which allowed dialogue, exploration, and hope.

Bringhurst	"As Mitt Romney is poised to launch his quest for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, he enters the race as the apparent front-runner--according to various recent polls. My presentation focuses on two questions: First, what are the reasons the former Massachusetts governor finds himself in the enviable position of ""front-runner""? Second, what are the potential pitfalls Romney could face in his second quest for the Republican nomination for president? In an attempt to answer the latter question, careful consideration will be given to the so-called ""Mormon question,"" stemming from Romney's LDS faith--an issue in 2008 which limited his appeal to Christian Evangelicals--the latter constituting a ""major base"" of the Republican Party. Also considered will be other hinderances that could derail Romney's effort."

Less has been said about Smith's peculiar fascination with llineage and blood relation. Early Mormon scriptures feature hereditary records, hereditary priesthoods, hereditary blessings, hereditary curses, hereditary offices, and even hereditary names. They also single out firstborn sons for special privileges and prerogatives. This paper will contextualize Joseph's views on heredity against the backdrop of the Bible, nineteenth-century folk religion, and Smith family dynamics. It will also explore how Joseph's fascination with heredity influenced his views on race and gender and informed his practice of polgamy to ""rise up seed."""

In the years since, what efforts have beenmade by LDS church members, leaders, and by people of otherfaiths to help heal from this divisive chapter that pitted politics andreligion against each other?What can straight/Mormon/religious allies do to facilitate thehealing process and support lGBTQ family members, congregationmembers, and friends who are struggling? what will assure thelGBTQ members of our religious communities that our healingovertures are genuine? what can Mormons learn from people ofother faiths who support marriage equality? And how can weapproach this polarizing topic with the empathy, compassion, andlove that all God’s children deserve?Our panelists bring many perspectives to this discussion.

Smith	"In the 1960s-1970s, Jose Davila and John Brewer independently discovered and translated various Nephite and Jaredite writings in central Utah. Though they regarded themselves as scientists, Davila and Brewer modeled their enterprise on the Joseph Smith story and the LDS prophetic tradition and actively sought acceptance by Church authorities and Mormon academics. After some initial encouragement, their activity was gradually marginalized. It was partly by differentiating itself from men such as Davila and Brewer that Book of Mormon archaeology became the formal discipline it is today."

In part, the poet takes these things (human communication and communion) as acts of interpretation. I follow his lead by interpreting ""Eden""--its lush and sensual language, its Edenic mythology so based in the poet's Mormonism and so resonant with mine--in a personal essay I wrote about and in response to the poem and from which I'll read after I present the poem. Although I try in my essay to tease deeper meaning from ""Eden,"" I don't intend to pin the poem down to a single interpretation. Instead I use my prose to explore the relationships among language (particularly poetic language), sex and human embodiement, and Mormonism's sexual taboos and its deeper theology of desire."

In many Melanesian cultures, the concept of the individual as a sole agentive subject is lacking. Instead, people think of themselves as dividuals, or partible agents whose primary ontological status is that of a"	SW12006	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SW12006.mp3																				MONSTERS AND MORMONS: RECLAIMING PULP FICTION MORMONS FROM COMIC CLICHES AND STOCK VILLAINS	Brian Gibson	"Early pulp fiction featured Mormons as comic clichés and stock villains. But what if Mormons wrote their own pulp stories? Is the world ready for demon-fighting bishops? Ghost pirate ships on the Great Salt Lake? Zombie-fighting missionaries? And can a sci-fi story written by a Mormon, about a Mormon, win a Nebula? Contributing authors Brian Gibson and Erik Peterson discuss Mormons in popular culture and the new fiction anthology, Monsters & Mormons, a bit of cultural re-appropriation Dr. Terryl Givens said, “…could well serve as an ironic commentary on the contemporary situation, as much as it reveals a healthy coming-to-terms with the Mormon past."""

REVIEWING WOMEN AND AUTHORITY AT TWENTY	"Lorie Winder, Doe Daughtrey, Rachel Hunt Steenblik, Maxine Hanks"	"Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism made a splash when it was published in 1992. On its 20th anniversary, panelists will discuss how they first encountered the book, their thoughts upon reading it, how it influenced their thinking about women's issues in the Church, and if it has continued to be a useful volume in their personal or academic pursuits."

Many of Mitt’s ancestors, such as Parley P. and Mary Wood Pratt, Archibald Newell Hill, Charles Henry and Eliza Christine Wilcken, Miles Park and Hannah Hood Hill Romney, and Helaman and Dora Wilcken Pratt, participated in this unique marriage system. Their life histories offer a revealing cross section of the Principle, showing what it meant to live in plurality in nineteenth-century Nauvoo, Utah, Arizona, and Mexico."

RECENT MORMON AND SCIENTOLOGY ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS	Donald Westbrook	"In addition to being uniquely American religious movements, the LDS Church and Church of Scientology were founded by individuals who perceived themselves as offering unique theological or spiritual corrective. This presentation offers a comparative analysis and critique of recent marketing efforts by both churches to introduce the public to ordinary Mormons and Scientologists via the “I am a Mormon” and “I am a Scientologist” campaigns."

What happens when religious feminists confront these kinds of attitudes and challenges—not from outsiders—but from within the ranks of their own religious communities? Panelists will discuss their experiences with the challenges they’ve encountered in their feminist religious lives."

From the equalRights amendment through California’sProposition 8, the LDS Church has played acrucial if episodic role in the country’s culturewars. As a voting bloc, Mormons have becomean anchor of the GOP—the most Republican ofany religious grouping. and ideologically, Mormonconceptions of the United States and its foundinghave helped imbue the Republican Party with anew restorationist political religion. As theRepublicans prepare to nominate a Mormon astheir presidential nominee, this lecture will examinethis new restorationism in the context ofnational religious politics, showing how itepitomizes the arrival of the Mormon communityin the political mainstream."

The far-reachingprogram of managing the perception ofthe Church with branding has had a significanteffect on how the Church is viewed today and setthe path for acceptance in political and culturalarenas."

Kestler,  Joseph West"	"Mormon doctrine decrees that opposition exists inall things, to the extent that everything that manifests is a compound in one (2 Nephi 2:11). Weare also invited to grow and develop in capacitytoward the fullness of our divine potential. Thesetwo Mormon concepts provide ground for a newsocial and political movement. In the past fewdecades, developmental psychology has clarifiedthat a person’s grasp of polarities with regard toconceptual (including political) understandingsmoves in an invariable progression based onone’s rising developmental center of gravity. Thispresentation will lay the groundwork for a moremature approach to civic engagement, politics,governance, and policy which transcends andincludes both conservatism and liberalism—suggestingthe related importance of personal internalgrowth."

But in the case of torture, although condemning inhumane treatment of others, the Church failed to join with other groups in any serious attempt to designate torture as outside the realm of moral behavior. Furthermore, many Mormons were among the leaders in our country who created torture methods and attempted to legalize the activity during the Bush Administration. The Church wants a stronger voice in the public square, but how can it reconcile this desire with the selective choices it makes as to which moral beliefs it will support?"

Augustawas Brigham’s second plural wife of some 55total. A Boston Brahmin, herbalist, and culturalfeminist, Augusta abandoned her wealthy firsthusband and six of her children to marry Brighamyoung in 1843. Her letters are a treasure trove,replete with the details of broader Mormon historyas well as a failing and acrimonious marriage.Separating Brigham the prophet from Brighamthe man, Augusta claimed he refused to reciprocateher love for him, often unfairly chastised her,played his favorite wives against her, and onoccasion even whipped her. Although shecomplained bitterly, like singer Patsy Cline, themore he abused her, the more she vowed to winback his heart. While they never divorced,Augusta repeatedly requested to be sealed foreternity to scores of different men, includingJesus Christ. Brigham did finally cancel theireternal sealing and had her sealed to JosephSmith in 1848."

Even (or perhaps especially)those at the forefront of technological innovationfind it hard to keep up. Despite its challenges,this era also presents unprecedented opportunitiesas various barriers to entry are lowered ineducation and other economic sectors. How dowe successfully navigate these challenges andopportunities? This presentation will review historicaltrends that can shed light on our presentchallenges and suggest ways of better preparingto meet them. It will also discuss surprisingexpert predictions about the near future and howthey might radically affect our everyday lives."

Brown	"In spring 2008, I made a decision that wouldchange my life forever, alienate my family, causeme to lose friends, and break my heart. In spiteof all this, I am absolutely certain I made the rightdecision when I finally decided to give up mybelief in the LDS Church and its teachings.The first question I’m typically asked by Mormonswho discover I used to believe and no longer dois, “Why did you leave?” I’ve never found ananswer that satisfied most true-believingMormons. The second question is, “Did someoneoffend you?” Well, yes. Human beings dooffensive things, and humans are sometimesoffended. But that is not remotely why I left."

Taken primarily fromWestern art, they show how our reality is shapedby the images we make and how our limiteddiscourse about the Female God has also limitedour access to her. It will explore the importance ofthe body as a symbol of the divine connectinghumans with God. Holly Welker will discuss her collaboration with artist Galen Dara on the cover of the recent SUNSTONE Motherhood Issue, which depictsHeavenly Mother animating Eve with a touch ofher divine finger, as well as illustrations inside themagazine of four possible manifestations of theMother God. A purpose in this presentation is tohelp women see themselves and their bodies asa reflection of God the Mother; another is to expand our vision of what she is like, so that wesee her not only as mother, but as daughter,lover, friend, priestess, queen, and more."

In its first year, LDSDems has quickly become the largest caucus ofthe Democratic Party.

We’ll hear from poets featuredin the anthology and consider its significancein LDS literary history."

As David Hume predicted,they feel a strong connection to the actorsand events, which helps them internalize thedoctrines. But when some Saints lose their faith inthe historicity of the Book of Mormon, they feelcompelled to abandon it as completely false. ifwe can read the Book of Mormon as a fictitioustext—what Hume calls a romance—then we canembrace the truth we find in the text withoutbeing dissuaded by the perceived improbabilitiesand inconsistencies that shatter the faith of theeither/or believer. Part II: I always thought of fairy tales as entertaining stories for children. But having recently readmany different fairy tales, I discovered that theyspeak profoundly to me (which may confirm thatI have entered second childhood). Furthermore,I think they reveal truths that, by right of doctrine,and by public assertion, all Latter-daySaints confess they seek. In this presentation, Isuggest there is something of the fairy tale inevery religious denomination’s preferred story,with a particular focus on the LDS Church. Ihope to show that fairy tales have more to sayabout life’s journey, spiritual and secular, thanmany of the cherished stories heard at church."

What is the role ofapologetics in general—both in and beyondMormonism? Do Mormon apologists use similarstances or tactics as non-Mormon apologists?Who are some good, effective apologists andwhat can we—and Mormon Studies in general—learn from their approaches? What might emergefrom a “new direction” for the Maxwell Instituteand its publications? Would it help or hinder theChurch as an organization to outsource apologeticsand encourage FAIR to pick up where MI isapparently leaving off?"

Stevens"	"The feminist slogan, “the personal is political,”calls attention to the profound relationshipbetween power structures and personal life.Personal problems are often rooted in political,economic, cultural, and religious systems.Section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants warnsus that even divinely ordained power can beabused. This panel will look at power structuresand relationships in the LDS Church. How doesthe structure of power influence the ways inwhich women and men use and experiencepower in the Church? By focusing on the abuseof power, we hope to shed light on both thestructure and righteous use of power."

This panelwill discuss the theory behind Occupy movementsand the strong parallels between Mormonscripture and Occupy movements in terms of critiques/solutions. We argue that as Samuel occupied the center of political and economic power inZarahemla to decry the evils of his day, theOccupy movement is a modern voice of dissentakin to Samuel crying out at Wall Street againstmany of the same evils. Whether we will repentand create a more equitable and just society orgrasp after treasures that become even moreslippery remains to be seen."

Snuffer, Thomas Alexander"	"Brigham Young’s brief tenure (1851–58) as territorialgovernor and Church president allowed himto wield power of both church and state. How heused this authority reveals much about the man.His sermons during his brief reign as both God’srepresentative and United States’ regent revealhow tempting the use of church and state powerbecomes once consolidated. His “TelestialKingdom” reflected excesses not only of rhetoric,but also of conduct. This paper will explore thisperiod as a challenge to conceptualizing how a“king’s rule” is unsuited to the American republicand will include cautions from the Book ofMormon against attempting this very thing."

These are practices andtalents inherent in ancient and modern prophets.Early members of the Church practiced these skillsopenly for personal revelation and personal stewardships. Are you a closeted or awakening shaman? Would you like to develop your shaman within to receive more powerful personal revelation?Learn from Mormon shamans Renee Shaw“Ryxi” and James Torgersen how being a Mormonand a shaman can be one and the same."

Thegroup believes that gaming the US governmentfor resources is a noble act in retribution foroppression. A loophole in Utah and Arizona lawmeans that if your house is a certain percentageunfinished, you do not have to pay propertytaxes. The FLDS sect practices the United order,a form of nineteenth-century Christian communalism.All property in the community is owned bythe FLDS church trust. In over 200 images ofcurrently inhabited homes, fewer than ten arefully finished. Though many members ownsuccessful construction businesses, the imagesof this town could be perceived as a statement onthe US housing crisis."

Wood was a visionary in many ways:first, he purchased property in Missouri, Illinois,Ohio, and Pennsylvania that later became officialLDS historic sites. Second, he collected historicalartifacts such as the death masks of Joseph andHyrum. Third, he claimed visions the LDScommunity considered appropriate only for apostles.An example of one of his visions is the reenactmentof the restoration of the MelchizedekPriesthood. This paper will provide details ofsome of Wood’s visions and examples of hispurchases of property and artifacts."

The TeaParty says he’s insufficiently conservative whilethe poor say he’s too rich. And now B’nai B’rithsays that unless he gets the Mormon Church todiscontinue its practice of baptizing dead Jews,they won’t vote for him either.

Eugene Needham, Jared Anderson"	"Joseph Smith has been called a “prophet puzzle”by historians who find him enigmatic. Part of theanswer to the prophet puzzle lies in Joseph’sadherence to the themes and teachings of theBible. It is this preoccupation with the Bible andits precepts, scope, and ancient, non-Westernsettings that make Smith’s teachings seemstrange. This session will argue that JosephSmith’s teachings—including covenants, election,gathering, the pre-existence, three degrees ofglory, the anthropomorphic nature of God,polygamy, and the plurality of gods—find precedentin and add to the Bible."

Singer, Margaret Toscano, Kaimipono Wenger, Rachel Mabey Whipple"	"President Hinckley has told us that Jesus Christforbids our praying to Heavenly Mother. But heavenlyparents who refuse communication with theirchildren seem unworthy of their status as gods,and a mother who will not hear or acknowledgeher children is not a helpful role model for LatterdaySaints. Therefore, there must be somemethod available in Mormon belief and practicefor communicating with God the Mother; perhapswriting letters is an acceptable means? In thissession, participants will read short prepared letters(three to four minutes) to God the Mother asa way of talking to and about her. An LDS feministtheologian will offer an invocation at its beginningand bless it at its conclusion.

Rees, Patrick Mason, Jennifer Dobner"	"Anti-Mormonism has been called one of the lastacceptable prejudices in American culture. Thepopularity of HBO’s Big Love, the success of TheBook of Mormon musical, LDS involvement inProposition 8, and Mitt Romney’s quest for theUS presidency have placed The Church of JesusChrist of Latter-day Saints front and center inAmerican culture, leading to what some havecalled the “Mormon Moment” but also to aresurgence of anti-Mormonism. This panelexplores the history of anti-Mormonism inAmerica, examines various kinds of anti-Mormonism unleashed in the current presidentialcampaign, and considers reactions to it fromMormons and others."

"Omar Kader, David Scott, Karen Williams McCreary, Russell Arben Fox"	"What should we make of recent claims that religionis somehow being driven out of the “publicsquare”? What is the public square and what arethe legal rules and—equally important—the ethicalconsiderations governing public expression onreligious issues? When should individuals, organizations,and businesses have a right to claim anexemption from neutral laws and regulations onreligious grounds? Within the structure of the First Amendment, the Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause are two sides of the same coin. They work together to ensure that many faith traditionsand moral codes can be observed, simultaneouslyand respectfully, by those living in the US. Butyou wouldn’t know it from the sensational coverageof reproductive health issues, the misrepresentationof Islam in the popular media, and thepersistent insistence that our nation be recognizedas an essentially Christian one.

It abstractscertain features and enables us to see hiddenrealities. In her popular trilogy, The HungerGames, Suzanne Collins gives us a parable thatreveals the hidden face of evil. This paper willcompare The Hunger Games to Jesus’ parablesof judgment and explore the questions: What isthe nature of evil? How do we deal with evil withoutourselves becoming evil? What is God’sresponse to evil? And how will Christ bring abouthis peaceable kingdom?"

It was also illegal, often secret, andpublicly denied by Church leaders, frequentlyforcing people in polygamous marriages into exilein Mexico and elsewhere. Many Romney ancestors,including Parley P. and Mary Wood Pratt,Archibald Newell Hill, Charles Henry and ElizaChristine Wilcken, Miles Park and Hannah HoodHill Romney, and Helaman and Dora WilckenPratt, practiced polygamy. Their stories offer arevealing cross section of the principle, showingwhat it meant to live in plurality in nineteenth-centuryNauvoo, Utah, Arizona, and Mexico."

Russell	"The candidacy of Mitt Romney in 2008 and 2012,and those of other candidates such as RickSantorum and Michelle Bachmann, has raisedthe question of whether a political candidate’sreligious beliefs should be a campaign issue. Doconstitutional provisions regarding “no religioustest” and “no establishment of religion” mean religionshould be irrelevant when citizens decidehow to vote? Particular focus will be on Mormonand Religious Right candidates."

Michael Quinn"	"On 27 June 1844, Joseph Smith was assassinated,leaving behind several claimants to leadershipwith no clear process for selecting a successor.Using archival data, we reconstruct the complexnetwork of relations that existed among 76members of the early LDS Church hierarchy. Thisincludes a mapping of formal ties within andbetween priesthood quorums as well as familyand marriage ties. Drawing on Burt’s theory ofstructural holes and other formal methods ofsocial network analysis, we examine the underlyingstructural factors that contributed to the resolutionof the succession crisis. While BrighamYoung was only one of several potential successors,our analysis uses formal models to evaluatehis ability to gain control of the structure, eliminate contenders by restructuring the formal andinformal network of relations to his advantage,and eventually to emerge as the new prophet andpresident of the Church."

"Clifton Holt Jolley, Emily Warburton Jensen"	"In 2006, Clifton Jolley was invited to respond to aSUNSTONE presentation by Los Angeles Timesreligion editor William Lobdell. In Lobdell’s subsequentbook, Losing My Religion (2009, HarperCollins), a significant part of the concluding chapter is devoted to describing the effect of Jolley’s remarks on Lobdell, and to the confusion those remarks still cause the one-time believer. Jolley will discuss the failure of Lobdell’s faith andrespond to the questions—both stated and implied—that the book asks not only of Dr. Jolley, but of all Mormons."

An unquestioned,aggressively supported faith tends to dismiss logical argument and evidentiary consideration, thereby involving the abdication of one’s responsibility as a thoughtful moral agent. This is a form of pride that continues to be highlydestructive in many forms outside of religion,including those of persistent tribalism and ideologicalextremism. This paper discusses unflinching,uncritical faith as a sin of pride, one that isindeed a stumbling block to the LDS community."

"Margaret Toscano, Jill Peterfeso"	"Mormon feminists sense that the current“Mormon Moment” offers a good time for activismthat draws attention to LDS women’s issues on alarge scale. But what kind of act could match thesignificance of this “Mormon Moment”? Manyfeminists, myself included, have long argued thatpriesthood is the central issue for women in theChurch because no significant changes can happenfor women as long as an all-male priesthoodcontrols all resources, discourses, and institutionalpower. Is it time to follow the example ofCatholic “womenpriests” who claim to have beenordained privately by a bishop in good standing,beginning in 2002, even though the Vatican subsequently excommunicated the priests and womenpriests involved? This paper will explore the practical challenges if such a movement were to emerge among LDS women, as well as the theological and spiritual underpinnings for the idea inMormon practice and doctrine."

Rees, Greg Robinson"	"A 2008 SUNSTONE Symposium session examinedthe range of political cartoons featuring MittRomney during the 2008 Republican primaryrace. Romney, now the party’s 2012 candidate,has been the subject of hundreds of political cartoonssince 2008, but especially in 2011–12. Thissession looks at a selection of these cartoonsand considers their role in presenting Romney asa candidate, with special emphasis on his identificationwith Mormonism. It will also consider theeffect of such political graphics on the image ofthe Church itself."

Wilkinson stated,“There is certainly a spirit of unrest throughoutthe country and while it is manifest only slightly atthe BYU it is nevertheless manifested here.”Student political activism at BYU during the late1960s to early 1970s was, like student activismelsewhere, as much a function of the school’sprevailing culture as of activist trends nationally.BYU students across the political spectrumresponded to local and national events in waysboth informed by and in reaction to political andintellectual currents on the Utah Valley campus.Thus any discussion of BYU student activismmust also examine the political climate at thisLDS school. Such an examination locates BYUactivism as occurring at an institution alreadypoliticized by an outspoken president, a mostly—but not entirely—sympathetic Board of Trustees,and a faculty and student body espousing somewhatbroader political interests."

The history of the burials andmemorializations of Emma and her second husband,Lewis Bidamon, are central to the paper’sanalysis. Utilizing archival sources and ethnographicfieldwork, the paper investigates theways by which the memorials to Joseph andEmma mediate Mormons’ attention to and knowledgeof the history of plural marriage."

The Deep West is conceivedof as the adjacent heartlands of the ColoradoRockies and plateau in Eastern Utah, WesternColorado, Northern Arizona, and New Mexico,along with the area’s deeper native and culturalbedrock. We’ll begin by mapping its fiveurban/geologic edges and fifteen inner “corners,”then explore the nine cultural archetypes/forcesthat characterize Deep Western conflicts/geopolitics,including the native, colonizer, operator, trader,agent, and stockman. Finally, we’ll use thisframework to illuminate exemplary archetypalclashes in four Deep West corners."

Lambert, Marybeth Raynes"	"People often behave, think, and respond emotionallyaccording to patterns dictated by deeplyentrenched beliefs, assumptions, perceived obligations,fears, and distortions taken from theirreligious, cultural, and family teachings and rolemodeling. All cultures and families create thisdynamic, which is not necessarily good or bad,but is still decidedly real. When the resultingbehaviors and reactions are problematic, contradictory,or self-destructive, it is often becausethey are based on “thinking errors.” Cognitivebehavioral therapy helps identify “thinking errors”as well as some of the forces that helped producethem. This session will explore some of the“thinking errors” common in Mormon culture."

Rees"	"Part I: Widespread Mormon understanding holds thatAmerica—the United States in particular—is populatedby a chosen people, governed by aninspired constitution, and possessor of a singulardestiny. This belief has drawn attention outsideMormon ranks in light of Mitt Romney’s candidacyfor the presidency: Would Mormon notionscolor a president Romney’s foreign policy? Therole the US plays in Mormon thought and culture,however, is more complex than it first appears.Understanding this evolving role requires pairing“American exceptionalism” with “religious exceptionalism”as they function in the Mormon mind.In each of these spheres, there inheres an originallydominant exceptionalist gene and a contrastingrecessive gene that challenges exceptionalistassurance. For instance, as Hebrewprophets reminded ancient Israel, “chosenness”may imply “selected for a role” rather than “superior.”Moreover, the proportional influence ofthese genes has shifted over time; the influenceof the recessive genes is now stronger. All thismeans that exceptionalism, while common inMormon culture, manifests in ways that arestrong, mild, absent, or even inverted in individualLatter-day Saints. Part II: How did Mormons enter the twentieth century?How did the frontier church of Brigham Youngbecome the polished, all-American faith of contemporaryAmerica? This presentation willexplore the transformation of Mormonism in theearly twentieth century, arguing that Mormonismfound a place for itself in American life by recognizingin itself the ideals of the classic Americanprogressive movement: optimism about humanity’sfuture, confidence in human potential, andfaith in the power of organization to accomplishthe fullest possibilities of what humansociety might become."

Jeff Burton, John Dehlin, Adam Fisher, Lilly Shults, Suzann Werner"	"When someone in an active Mormon familyenters the Borderlands, resulting stresses canweaken and overwhelm the family. Many react inways that reduce family love and cohesiveness,sometimes even destroying the family throughdivorce or estrangement. This session will firstprovide stories of family-related tensions and difficultiessome Borderlanders have encountered.Panel and audience members will then considerimportant questions: How should parents reactwhen a doubting teenager announces he cannotgo on a mission? How can a family support anemerging Borderlander through the trauma andheartbreak of the experience? What should wedo with a family member we suspect is in theBorderlands but pretends otherwise?

How has your Mormon backgroundaffected your creativity and the sense of yourplace in the world of writing? What are the politicalramifications of being a “Mormon” writer? Doyou feel an obligation to preach to the choir andadd your observations to that conversation?

What aboutMormonism is funny to Mormons and to non-Mormons? Does Mormon political and social lifesupport Karl Marx’s famous dictum that “historyrepeats itself: first as tragedy, then as farce”?

Her later work evolved to addresswomen’s body images and violence againstwomen. A 2001 SUNSTONE session entitled“Sacred Spaces: Mormon Women’s Faith andSexuality” and nicknamed “the Mormon VaginaMonologues” featured LDS women talking abouttheir faith and sexuality in ways inspired byEnsler’s groundbreaking play.

Many Latter-day Saints havetried to justify the ban, as when BYU professorRandy Bott offered an explanation in a recentWashington Post interview; his justification wascondemned by an official Church statement thenext day. This essay will examine the historicalrecord for clues that can help us determine more“precisely why, how, or when this restrictionbegan” and will look at a group of interracialmarriages in the 1840s that appear to haveinfluenced early Church leaders’ thoughts on thepropriety of such relationships."

"John-Charles Duffy, Bridget Jack Jeffries"	"Although Mormons and Evangelicals in the UStypically share conservative social values,Evangelicals’ theological opposition toMormonism periodically generates frictionbetween Mormons and the Evangelical Right.Recent examples include Mitt Romney’s 2008and 2012 presidential campaigns, Focus on theFamily’s 2008 decision to pull a Glenn Beck interviewfrom its website, and a 2004 effort to restrictMormons’ participation in an interfaith serviceorganized by the National day of prayer TaskForce.

What may be less obvious but moreimportant is that a highly formal and a highly uniformway of organizing local congregations actuallyworks better in certain kinds of places.

Many consider it the originalsource of the corruption of science, while otherlaboratory and community leaders of good intentin Los Alamos ignore or deny charges of corruption.This paper describes the purported corruption,LDS and Native American influences at theLaboratory, and suggests a way that Mormonscan set an example of “deep democracy” awarenessand community transformation."

ManyMormons maintain that the accounts of the visionare historically accurate, while critics assert that different accounts are inconsistent and historically inaccurate. This session will summarize the various accounts and give an overview of the evidence for and against the historicity of various parts of the vision, including a summary of eight criteria for assessing historical authenticity.

Hales, Lorie Winder, Todd Compton"	"Part I: Of Joseph Smith’s 34 plural wives, 13 had legalhusbands at the time they were sealed to him.Since Fawn Brodie’s 1945 No Man Knows MyHistory, virtually every author who has writtenabout Nauvoo plural marriages has concludedthat the prophet practiced sexual polyandry (or atleast may have) with some or all of these women.However, since the beginning of the Church,polyandrous sexuality has been consistently condemnedby Church leaders—after all, womentoday cannot be sealed to more than one man ata time. So what was going on? Did Joseph Smithpractice sexual polyandry? If so, was it in accordancewith his teachings or contradictory tothem? This session will examine the evidence. Part II: That a number of Mormon plural wives wereimprisoned during the late nineteenth century andbecame the focus of intense public controversyhas been relegated to little more than a footnotein Latter-day Saint histories. Their cases meritattention because they occupy an often precedent-setting place in the history of the antipolygamylegislative and judicial crusades andhave significant revelatory value as barometers ofpublic sentiment. Further, they invite us to considerthe problem of plural wives as agents within apatriarchal religious tradition and the competingnarratives that often portray them as either heroicand autonomous or abused and victimized."

Too often, Mormon conservatives viewtheir liberal sisters and brothers as apostates orwolves in sheep’s clothing who seek to weakenor damage the Church. Such a view is notunwarranted as Mormon liberals have oftendefined themselves not by their own values butinstead by what they reject within cultural orthodoxy.This presentation proposes a constructiveform of Mormon liberalism which seeks to be partof Mormonism on its own terms as well as aforce for good within the wider community."

Michael Quinn"	"Shortly after Willard Richards arrived in Nauvoofrom England in August 1841, he became JosephSmith’s closest confidant, assuming a role onceenjoyed by John C. Bennett. Bennett’s departurefrom Mormonism was not quiet, and as he touredthe country exposing and sensationalizingMormon secrets, including polygamy, Richardsfollowed doing damage control. Yet Richards wasa polygamy insider introduced to the practice byJoseph Smith. He had performed one of Smith’splural marriages and may have begun practicingit himself while his first wife, Jennetta, endured alonely year in Massachusetts where he’d left herwhile he settled in Nauvoo. This paper examinesRichards’s role as a polygamy insider, confidant,and public relations man during the tumultuous period of 1841-1842."

It alsoexamines the connections between the nineteenth-century restoration movement and itsrestored symbol of bee and hive, and the parallelemergence of the women’s movement and feministspirituality from the nineteenth century intothe twenty-first century."

Frederick (Toby) Pingree"	"An LDS mission is commonly called “the best twoyears” of one’s life. Most missionaries understandthe difficulties, pressure to perform, mission politics,boredom, depression, emotional demands,and physical hardships of a mission. However,there is an unwritten rule never to speak negativelyabout one’s mission. Consequently, homecomingsare typically uplifting pep talks, and candiddiscussion of one’s mission often provokeshostility. This session will explore the explicit andimplicit pressure to spin missions positively andhow this affects people, as well as offer ideasabout how to acknowledge unpleasant reality in aculture that frowns on bluntness."

Kesler	"This session will detail John’s development ofIntegral polarity practice (IPP), an approach tomeditation, awareness, and action aligned withpatterns of the Restored Gospel. IPP is not animproved way to practice Mormonism, but aseries of practices to help one deepen in awareness,become more integrated, grow to higherlevels of human development, and embrace theworld virtuously. This session explains how correlationsbetween IPP and the mystical practices ofmany traditions demonstrate that the RestoredGospel includes the wisdom of the East—morethan any other Western traditions."

The most fundamental way to participate in the political process is to register to vote and go tothe polls. In the LDS Church, leaders are expectedto set an example. This presentation willexamine the level of political involvement andgeneral voting habits of LDS general authorities,stake presidents, and bishops in central Utah."

"Carol Hamer, Jon Adams, Donna Banta, Jason Echols, Jeff Ricks, John K. Williams"	"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saintslikes to believe that the only ones qualified to talkabout Mormonism are its most faithful members,or—ideally—the Church itself, through its appointedspokesmen. And, being a multi-billion-dollaroperation, it has the resources to convincepeople through organizations such as the MoreGood Foundation, Mormon Voices (a.k.a. theMormon defense League), and the WashingtonPost column of Church PR managing directorMichael Otterson. The irony is that the Church has no hesitation about making up all sorts of inaccurate (and often insulting) claims about what ex-Mormons—“apostates”— are like. We may not have as muchmoney or political clout as the LDS Church, butusing tools such as the Internet, we can takeownership of our own narratives and claim ourplace in the public discourse on Mormonism."

Panelists will discusstheir experiences reaching across thegay/straight divide and working inside andoutside the Church in a process that not onlyhelps change the perceptions the LGBTcommunity has about Mormons but also can helpbring about change within the Church."

Paul Toscano	"This presentation concerns the LDS Church PublicRelations Department’s attempt to shift the blamefor the Church’s past racism onto the Lord. Thepresenter critiques Elder Todd Christofferson’srecent attempt to shift onto Church members theresponsibility of distinguishing Church leaders’opinions from binding doctrine; Toscano claims thathe was excommunicated almost 19 years ago forholding then the same views Elder Christoffersonexpresses now. His voice then shifts from critic toapologist as he explains why he still believes inmany Mormon teachings while rejecting certain elementsof corporate Mormonism. In doing so, heexplores the roles of proof, preference, facts, faith,history, myth, reason, intuition, imagination, andspiritual encounters in human existence, and disclosessome surprising close encounters from hisown life."

Spread across the political spectrumand operating at every level of government,Latinos cannot be counted on to vote as a bloc,but their collective support can make or break apolitical campaign. In the Intermountain West,Latino-Mormon politics can often seem focusedalmost exclusively on matters regarding immigration,but these are not the only political issues ofconcern to LDS Latinos. How do LDS Latinosorganize to affect local, state, and federal politics,and how do LDS missionary efforts among Latinocommunities affect various political issues?"

"Carol Hamer, Aaron Taylor, Andrew Spriggs, Bridget Jack Jeffries, Cheryl Bruno, Jason Echols, Kaimipono Wenger, Rachel Mabey Whipple"	"LDS-interest blogspace is divided into many differentcommunities: Mormon feminists, Mormonmommies, Borderlanders (or New OrderMormons), interfaith discussion blogs, NothingWavering, Outer Blogness, the core of theBloggernacle, and probably others. All of thesecommunities overlap and communicate with oneanother, but they also do various types of boundary-maintenance to decide who’s in and who’sout. Some of the division is simply a question ofpeople wanting to spend their limited Internettime with people they can relate to, but some of itis a genuine power struggle over who gets to representMormonism. Should the various LDS-interestgroups strive for better communication andcooperation, or are we happier staying out ofeach other’s hair? Representatives of variouscommunities discuss."

Christian Harrison, Jeremiah John"	"The so-called “Mormon Moment” of 2011 and2012 has involved sojourns into the doctrines,theology, history, everyday practices, sociology,and scandals of The Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-day Saints, with guides both ignorant andwell-informed about Mormonism, both sympatheticand hostile to its people. Like it or not, such aresponse to phenomena such as The Book ofMormon musical and Mitt Romney’s presidentialcandidacy was predictable and may prove beneficialto the development of Mormonism as a religious“player” in the United States. But how aremembers of the LDS Church themselvesresponding to this moment in the spotlight? Whatdo they make of it? What can they make of it?This panel attempts to answer those questions."

Rees, Charles Randall Paul, Kendall Wilcox, Emily Clyde Curtis, Warner Woodworth"	"Empathy is the ability to understand and, on adeeply caring level, respond to the needs of othercreatures. Alma speaks of followers of Christ asthose who are “willing to bear one another’s burdens,. . . mourn with those that mourn, . . . andcomfort those that stand in need of comfort.” Andyet there seems to be a paucity of empathy inmodern society, including among Christians (and,therefore, Mormons). This panel explores thenature and various dimensions of these virtues,their biological and spiritual roots, their strengthsand insufficiencies in a hierarchical contest withlove for a global universal value, and the degreeto which they are manifest or lacking in Mormonreligious practice."	SL12353	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL12353.mp3																				EIGHTEEN MONTHS ON THE PERIPHERY: THE EXPERIENCE OF SISTER MISSIONARIES	"Tamara Taysom, Krista Mecham"	"LDS missions have long been recognized as arite of passage for young Mormon men, yetyoung women can and often do serve as full-timemissionaries. Some sister missionaries report thattheir mission experiences were positive and stimulating,while others find that missions marginalizewomen and can carry a lifelong stigma.General Conference talks, the structure of missionhierarchy, and snide remarks by Mormon men to sister missionaries all reinforce the ideathat women are not wanted in the mission field.This panel will discuss the experiences of sistermissionaries, talk about how the mission experiencecan be both empowering and alienating forwomen, and explore why LDS men are often soproprietary about this unique Mormon experience."	SL12354	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL12354.mp3																				TWO-PAPER SESSION ON B. H. ROBERTS	"Christopher Smith, Joe Geisner, D. Michael Quinn"	"Part I: In 1908 and 1909, B.H. Roberts learned thatsome high-level LDS leaders continued to sanctionsecret polygamous marriages despite the twoManifestos forbidding the practice. Roberts comparedthis situation to president Smith’s “whispercampaign” supporting the Republican Party inviolation of the Church’s policy of political neutrality.At the October 1909 General Conference,Roberts denounced such double-dealing as astain on the Church’s honor and pleaded forintegrity and consistency in Church marriage policy.But what Roberts, a polygamist andDemocrat, seems to have really wanted was forthe Church to drop the pretense of monogamyand political neutrality altogether and to openlyendorse polygamy and the Democrats. Roberts’sconference talk doubles as a critique of both thesecret violation of the polygamy ban and of theban itself. Both represented a breach of faithfulnessto the laws of God and the Church. Part II: This paper will explore the life and legacy of B.H.Roberts and his Mormon faith. The publication ofB.H. Roberts’s Studies in the Book of Mormon in1985 led many to conclude that at the end of hislife, Roberts had lost his faith in the Book ofMormon as an ancient record. one must thereforeask, “Why did Roberts not leaveMormonism?” This paper will demonstrate thateven after this crisis of faith, Roberts remainedMormon through and through."

California’s proposition 8 was adefining piece of legislation that has brought thisquestion to the forefront not only of LDS Churchpolicy and doctrine, but also national and internationalpolitical dialogue."

Popular reaction to their unconventionaldesigns was mixed at best. While many peopleaccepted the buildings without question, othersfound them unattractive. An evaluation 40 yearsafter their dedication will explore the origin of theOgden/Provo temple designs. The designs reflectan attempt to create a modern, efficient temple inthe stylistic vocabulary of the time and representthe apex of Modernism in temple design. The twotemples set a benchmark for efficiency and reflectan era of optimism about what Mormonism couldachieve. Forty years later, the status of the twotemples indicates a further shift in the Mormonconcept of temples."

Morehead, Dan Wotherspoon"	"Reliable social science statistical data indicatesthat thousands of Latter-day Saints leave theLDS Church each year. Over time, these individualsadopt a variety of irreligious and religiouspathways as a result of their prior Mormon experience.Although the social scientific literatureincludes material that sheds light on religiousaffiliation, disaffiliation, and reaffiliation, this materialis rarely consulted as an aid to assisting othersin their spiritual migration. This seminar willdiscuss the background behind Transitions, anew video and workbook resource designed forimmigrants shifting from Mormonism to more traditionalforms of Christianity. It will consider theperspective and needs of the transitioner, themultidisciplinary perspectives and resources thatinform Transitions, and how religious institutionsmight better assist those making the journey fromone religious tradition to another."

Michael Marquardt	"Like other individuals, Joseph Smith developedhis ideas over time, as evidenced by the expansionof themes in his revelations and by his recollectionsof his early life assuming a theologicalnature. He seemed unconcerned that some of hisideas changed or contradicted previous positions.Joseph was able to express his interpretation ofevents as he presented new ideas in a revelatorymanner. Critical studies usually do not play a partin what a believer has experienced. What isimportant is how the story is told within the contextof faith."

Bringhurst, William D. Russell"	"Part I: This paper will focus on the media’s evolving perceptionsrelative to Mitt Romney’s Mormonism,specifically as it involved the so-called “MormonQuestion.” How have perceptions changed andshifted since the former Massachusetts governorannounced his candidacy in early 2011 and aswe approach the general election in whichRomney seeks the nation’s highest office? Part II: This paper will focus on how the media hasresponded to the respective candidacies of 1) formerUtah governor and ambassador to China JonHuntsman during his unsuccessful campaign forthe Gop nomination; 2) the “third party” challengeof former Salt Lake City Mayor RockyAnderson as he pursues the presidency as thecandidate of his own self-styled Justice Party;and 3) Roseanne Barr, a television personalityand one-time Latter-day Saint, in her bid for the2012 Green Party presidential nomination."	SL12373	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SL12373.mp3																				LOOK TO THE WEST: MORMONISM AND THE MASONIC WORLD VIEW	"Cheryl Bruno, Joe Swick"	"During sweeping social change of the 1820s,Americans became increasingly disenchantedwith Freemasonry as a kind of secular priesthood.The William Morgan affair (1826) led to ananti-Masonic movement fueled by fears that afree society could not thrive in the presence ofsecret organizations. Anti-masons argued thatmasons formed a secret combination bound bysecret rituals which contained immoral oaths;Masons secretly colluded outside the establishedboundaries of the political process, yet actedpolitically as a group; and that individual memberswere above the law. Most troubling,Freemasonry seemed to blur the line between thereligious and the secular. Mormonism is one ofthe last great flowerings inspired by pre-Morganstyle American Freemasonry, and it is significantthat similar concerns came to be expressedregarding presidential candidate Joseph Smithand the incipient Mormon kingdom. FollowingMasonic models in organizations such as theDanite Band, the Relief Society, the Council ofFifty, this theocratic kingdom struck fear in thehearts of many, both in and out of the Church."

In this session, we’lldiscuss the many kinds of direct action that challengeempire: artwork, riots, dance, strikes, fasting,sabotage, and prayer. We’ll discuss the history and theory of mass mobilizations, the theologyof collective redemption that inspires Mormons tochallenge imperialism through shared faith, andupcoming plans to defy Romney’s war/austerityagenda."

Global population isexpected to reach between 7.5 and 10.5 billionby 2050; will there be “enough and to spare”then? Does the revelation still apply? This panelwill explore a variety of interrelated topicsincluding: consumerism, resource management,population control, stewardship, green energy,and recycling. instead of being used to justifyAmerican consumerism and over-consumption,perhaps we will come to use this verse to actuallyeliminate poverty and establish Zion."

Whatis and is not protected under the FirstAmendment? The question has been asked oftenthroughout our nation’s history, each time with theblinding spotlight of public scrutiny shining on adifferent minority religious group—including, ofcourse, members of The Church of Jesus Christof Latter-day Saints.Though the role of scrutinized/persecutedminority religious group has not been an easy orparticularly pleasant one for Mormons to play,their struggles have contributed to a valuableservice for all Americans, religious and nonreligiousalike. The Mormon experience of pushingfor political, cultural, and social acceptance hashelped to shape our understanding—and expandour appreciation—of both the “free exercise” and“establishment” clauses of the First Amendment.From polygamy to the 2012 presidential race, theexperience of LDS Americans—politicians, prisoners,and proselytizers alike—has mirrored that of other minority religious groups pushing to both live out their faith and live fully as part of thepatchwork of our nation: Native Americans usingpeyote as part of religious ceremonies; Jehovah’sWitnesses abstaining from saying the Pledge ofAllegiance; Muslim students wearing headscarvesto public school; and Catholics rejectingevangelical Christian drug rehabilitation programsthat contradict their own faith—just toname a few! Join us to hear Eunice Rho of the AmericanCivil Liberties Union explore how Mormons andother religious minority groups have helped tostrengthen religious liberty in the United Statesby demanding that the government fully “enforce”the religion clauses of the First Amendment. Ms.Rho will also discuss how ongoing religious discriminationagainst different groups in differentparts of the country continues to keep the ACLUvery busy in defense of religious liberty."

Most information about temples—their history, use, theological significance, sociological and psychological importance—is readily available from Mormon Studies scholars and even the church itself, and temples are open for public tours before dedication. On the other hand, aspects of temple ceremonies, in particular the endowment, are not released to the public, or even to Mormons who are not temple worthy. Temple-worthy participants take vows not to reveal such elements, and they have been traditionally understood as “sacred not secret”—even if Mormons functionally understand them as both, and some outsiders disrespectfully consider them neither. This presentation explores the problematics of researching LDS temples for the non-Mormon scholar of Mormonism, and in particular seeks to answer two questions: for non-Mormons such as myself who respect sacred space, what methodological difficulties arise? Are there times when a religious tradition’s sense of the sacred is off-limits for full scholarly investigation, and if so, when and why? Relevant parallels from the Church of Scientology—another American-born religious tradition that engenders similar questions and challenges to outsiders—will be considered for context."

The history of the burials and memorializations of Emma and her second husband, Lewis Bidamon, are central to the paper’s analysis. Utilizing archival sources and ethnographic fieldwork, the paper investigates the ways by which the memorials to Joseph and Emma mediate Mormons’ attention to and knowledge of the history of plural marriage"	KL12006	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/KL12006.mp3																				The Book of Mormon as an Ancient Ascension Text	Gerald Smith	"Many Biblical and non-Biblical sources discuss ancient ascensions into the presence of God.  One source for such ascensions, which is often neglected by Latter-day Saints and others, is the Book of Mormon.  This paper will discuss the ancient concepts of ascension and theophany, and how the Book of Mormon has as a major underlying theme man’s effort to return back into God’s presence.  Ascension themes in the Book of Mormon will be compared and contrasted to those in other ancient texts, including Revelation, Ascension of Isaiah, and other ancient literature."

Objectivity about “how to study Joseph Smith” is a growing field of research and focus. This paper focuses on the application of both contemporary business and traditional psychological communication models to the “personality” of Joseph Smith. Principally, the presentation will provide a road map for getting past the  “Persecution Perceptions” that many (if not most) of the Joseph Smith scholars grapple with. Piercing the Paradigm of Persecution when it is part of one’s DNA is extremely difficult…and that need compellingly still exists in the constantly expanding field of Joseph Smith scholarship. Emotionally mature discussions of business behavior often fall into the simple 4-factor models dating from the Greeks. These models are reduced to the Four Key Questions of Behavior: Why? What? How? And Who? This paper will apply those dimensions to the emerging Joseph Smith Papers Persona of Joseph Smith and invite discussion of a simpler, more objective treatment of the apparent  contradictions in the evolving “picture” of Joseph Smith."

In reaction to apologists who insist on the First Vision’s historicity as a litmus test for the faith, some Latter Day Saints of a theologically liberal bent have tended toward the opposite view: that historicity doesn’t matter. This panel invites a second, and third, and fourth look at the issue. What is at stake in the historicity question? In what different ways do people negotiate those stakes?"

Where would LGBT Mormons and their allies most like to see improvement? How will LGBT/LDS relations continue to evolve?"

"Todd Compton, Mary Ellen Robertson, Lorie Winder, Margaret Toscano, Christine Haider-Winnett, Victoria Rue"	"Catholic and Mormon feminists share a deep love and respect for our religious communities; pursue a common mission to advocate for practical, equitable, and inclusive changes; and many feel a call to ministry as a way for  women’s spiritual gifts and power to  enrich the larger community. Today, we bring together four women from patriarchal religions to explore what happens when religious feminists call an all-male priesthood into question and examine the theological and cultural assumptions upon which an all-male priesthood rests. How can we help each other in advocating for ordination and expanded roles for women? Being aware of each other’s faith and concerns, becoming versed in each other’s prior activism, and working together can help swing the pendulum toward equality in both traditions."

Reed	"Although Joseph Smith and early Mormonism are not the main focus of this paper, I will present many interesting details that strongly parallel Joseph Smith’s religious beliefs and practices. Such details I suggest are important and useful for ascertaining the ways in which Joseph Smith’s treasure seeking activities informed his development/restoration of the Church."

Videos were produced explaining this new approach and were shown in many Wards including to adults. The theme of this new approach was that instructors will be presenting Gospel topics is a more thematic manner and are to act as ""facilitators"" more closely following the teaching pattern and example of Jesus Christ. In fact, such teaching styles are antithetical to those of the Savior, and represent a style which is much more aligned with the Post Modern era in which we live in than with Judeo-Christian roots. Is such change in approach a harbinger of things to come in the Church, and if so what might the ramifications of such changes be?"

In this paper, I would like to consider some of the issues surrounding mental illness that come up specifically in the context of LDS teachings. I will look at questions regarding its effects on agency and accountability; questions about how it relates to the nature of the self and identity, particularly in light of LDS beliefs about eternally existing intelligences; and finally, ways in which mental illness can affect spirituality"	SW13007	http://sunstonemagazine.com/audio/SW13007.mp3																				The New Western History and Mormon History	Todd Compton	"The leading historians of the “New Western History”—Patricia Limerick, Richard White, Don Worster and William Cronon—have dismantled Frederick Jackson Turner’s thesis that the American character was shaped by pioneers coming to virgin land. According to Limerick et al., pioneers came west to a land already occupied, by Indians, conquered them, then marginalized them. In this paper, I examine how Mormon history—the view of Mormon pioneers making the desert blossom like a rose, with Utah Indians seen as a passing annoyance, when they’re remembered at all—might fit into the New Western history."

While each group may have goals that differ from those of the other, are there significant ways they are similar?  What are the goals and initiatives of each group—and are the goals well defined and uncontested?  What are the parameters of feminist and LGBT advocacy in the Mormon community? With these questions in mind, panelists will discuss the Mormon feminist and LGBT advocacy movements and examine their points of intersection, including the critical role of allies in both causes."

Rees	"There has been considerable buzz in the blogosphere and elsewhere about a growing faith crisis among contemporary Mormons. This crisis of faith can be described as a state of intense emotional and spiritual distress resulting from the discovery of discrepancies between historical & scientific facts and the official LDS narrative. To what extent is the faith crisis real? What are its dimensions? What kinds of strategies should be considered to address it? What is the impact of electronic and social media on faith? This presentation is based on a survey of over 3,000 Latter-day Saints who have recently or are currently experiencing a faith crisis."

In this paper, I help answer the question of “What is ‘The Church’ anyway?” by: 1. Detailing the corporate history of The Corporation of the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and The Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 2.

As gun and healthcare debates sweep the nation, these issues, while potentially helpful, do little to address the root issue. Christ presented the best solution when He said, “Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.” (Matt 7:12) I submit that true gun control and suicide prevention is achievable when we stop making an “other” any of our brothers and sisters."

Bringhurst, Georgia Platts,"	"This presentation focuses on changing LDS perceptions of polygamy as practiced by Brigham Young. Based on an examination of various biographical accounts of the Nineteenth Century Mormon leader, we’ll consider three questions:  How have Latter-day Saint perceptions of Brigham Young as the polygamist husband to  55 women have changed and evolved over past 140 years? What explains the declining emphasis on Young’s polygamous role during the 20th century, as reflected in semi-official LDS Church writings and official statements?  What does this tell us about changing perceptions of polygamy among Latter-day Saints in general?"

Patterson	"Dr. Sara Patterson will explore the shifting gender expectations for med during the transition from a polygamous to a monogamous system. Examining how gender expectations were created and reinforced, she will investigate how sexual roles were and are tied to gender and religious beliefs in Mormonism. As she does so she will compare the gender expectations for Mormom men to those for Protestand men during the same period. Patterson will argue that Mormons fashioned a masculinity that would distinguish them from other Americans will at the same time claim a stake in American identity."

Anderson	"Shortly after Willard Richards arrived in Nauvoo for the first time in August 1841, he became Joseph Smith's closest confidant, assuming a role once enjoyed by John C. Bennett. Bennett's departure from Nauvoo and Mormonism was not a quiet one, and as he toured the country exposing and sensationalizing Mormon secrets (most notably, polygamy) Richards followed him doing damage control. Yet Richards was a polygamy insider, who had been introduced to the practice by Joseph Smith, had performed one of Smith's plural marriages, and may have even begun practicing it himself - all while Richard's wide, Jenetta, endured a lonely year in Massachusetts where he'd left her while he got settled in Nauvoo. This paper will examine Richard's rold as a polygamy insider, confidant, and public relations man during the tumultous period of 1841-42."

Bowman, Jr."	"LDS prophets and theologians, following Joseph Smith's own lead, often compare Joseph's ""first vision"" encounter with the Father and the Son to the experience of Saul of Tarsus (Paul) seeing the risen Jesus on the road to Damascus. The comparison forms the basis of several arguments defending the historical authenticity of the First Vision -- suggesting that the criticisms of the First Vision, if applied consistently, would also call into question the historicity of the resurrection of Christ. This paper engages these arguments and presents a case for de-coupling the two historical arguments."

""We are very concerned that our people [who are] going to the temple for the first time have a better introduction to the temple,"" said Apostle Mark E. Peterson to regional representatives in 1969. In that spirit, historian Devery S. Anderson brught together a comprehensive collection of official documents on temple ceremonies, limited only by what would be inappropriate to discuss publicly. What does the documentary history illuminate about temple worship, changes over time, and the experiences of Chutch leaders and members who participate? Can a thorough history create a deeper, thoughtfl understanding of temple ritual? How might this work impact longtime Church members or those comtemplating their first temple experience?
