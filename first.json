In new systems for public entrepreneurship, modern pioneers are blazing trails in today's Third World wilderness, suggesting paths others may take to act, to replicate, or otherwise move us toward a genuine Zion on earth. Differentiating between formal Church assignments and informal callings, many LDS advocates today are designing and developing strategies around the globe to empower “the least of these” among God's children. New, ethical visions are becoming linked with practical interventions to make a difference: laboring for justice, building a sense of community, bringing peace to the restless, feeding desperate mothers and their children, all helping to achieve personal redemption by engaging in sacred work among the poorest of the poor. I will examine key elements of social stewardship by LDS individuals, families, ward organizations, neighborhoods, and newly-established humanitarian institutions.",

Of course, it's not an arrival but a journey, a constant invitation to abide in the place of no fear. What does a mystic life demand? Likely Coleridge's “willing suspension of disbelief,” which is born in all children. A letting go to listen to the silence, to the spirit. With pioneers in my veins and my mother's “Pray at night, plan in the morning” in my growing up, I would add: Pay attention, maybe to what Plato calls “the divine madness of the poet.” Or more likely, to what is available to anyone as a believer, though having faith, opening the crown, and expecting. For anyone there await informings constant and reasonable, guides to living to the full measure of any day's potential.",

Americans and Mormons believe in freedom of speech but also in truth that prevails, in not suffering idiots or naysayers, and in saying something positive and faith-affirming or not saying anything at all. We believe there are things, in fact, that should not even be thought. It is not easy to endure someone who is enfranchised, as we are, to say what is right but who does not. This makes dialogue hard.",

Court genealogists for Queen Elizabeth and Ivan the Terrible attempted to link, through genealogy, the entire history of the world from beginning to end, and early Mormon leaders claimed Joseph Smith was of the same seed as the British royal house. My research on medieval European genealogies suggests that Mormons are recapitulating a fascination with lineal descent and genealogical myths that is centuries old. I suggest some reasons why a mythical genealogical history was defended so vehemently in the waning years of the Middle Ages and perhaps why it is equally cherished at the end of the 20th century.",

    "Presenters": "Dennis Clark, Elizabeth Huntington Hall",
    "Description": "THE GRAMMAR OF GLAMOUR, EROTICIZING THE ORDINARY Pornography traffics in the ordinary. There are few things more common in human life than sexual relations. Sex is, to the species, what food is to the individual: its continuation, the guarantor of its survival. And, as with food, a cult of the exotic surrounds sex: glamour is to sex what haute cuisine is to food. Pornography, though always available as a kind of literary junk food, has nosed its way into haute couture and popular culture as a chic frisson to glamorize the ordinary. As such, it constitutes a full-scale assault on intimacy, a marketing of the most spiritual of appetites, an invasion of wonder by advertising. Does the blatant commercialization of sex leave any room for wonder, for the “wonderful,” or will that word become, in regards to sex, as pejorative as “awful” now is in regards to worship?",

How did Straight Edge develop, and why has it reached such extremes in Utah? Moderator Michael Van Wagenen was involved in Straight Edge in Los Angeles during the movement's formative years.

    "Description": "TEN REASONS WHY SUNSTONE IS NOT A CULT, by Linda Sillitoe, and 'OH BOY! MORMONS' AND OTHER DISCOVERIES: AN UNSCIENTIFIC SURVEY, by Ardean Watts TEN REASONS SUNSTONE IS NOT A CULT. Of late, the symposium has been criticized for its cult-like influence. But Sunstone lacks the characteristics of a cult or charismatic group, often held suspect for exploiting members' resources and dominating their lives. For example: (1) Sunstone holds few meetings; charismatic groups meet often, sometimes even meeting to plan meetings. (2) Symposium participants express diverse beliefs while a cultist group resists questioning, let alone question-answer periods. (3) Sunstone does not monitor and punish sexuality, not even among the young. (4) Symposium participants do not endow Sunstone leaders with powers of inspiration and authority. 'OH BOY, MORMONS!” AND OTHER DISCOVERIES: AN UNSCIENTIFIC SURVEY. More than 200 attendees at the 1994 symposium took Ardean Watts's “Orthodoxy Test”, 36 statements on fundamental LDS beliefs. Respondents were invited to score yes, no, or in-between. The results have been ripening in a forgotten corner of my library for five years. During that time, the test's flaws became apparent and the results more surprising. The question “How do you describe your religious persuasion?” brought more than a hundred different answers including: “good for weddings and funerals” and “Oh, Boy! Mormon.” Attend this session if you are curious about the beliefs of the Sunstone community and for a light-minded look at the notion of orthodoxy.",

How do churches deal with inevitable conflict within the organization, with other organizations, with nonmembers, and between members? Is the LDS church unique in its conflict management methods? This study seeks to answer these questions and discover if there is anything to learn from an investigation of conflict resolution strategies of various faiths. Interorganizational, intraorganizational, and interpersonal issues will be examined. RELIGION AND THE “WAR ON DRUGS”: SOME THOUGHTS ON SPIRITUALITY AND MENDACITY. With help from the audience, I propose to explore three interrelated issues: (1) the reasons western, monotheistic religions have tended to vigorously oppose drug use; (2) the role of religious traditions in promoting spirituality; and (3) the apparent contribution by religious communities and their leaders to the very conditions that give rise to the culture of drugs.",

    "Description": "THE FULLNESS OF THE ATONEMENT: THE CHURCH'S MILLENNIAL MISSION, by Janice Allred; THE ATONEMENT AND THE LAW OF MOSES, by Benjamin Huff THE FULLNESS OF THE ATONEMENT: THE CHURCH'S MILLENNIAL MISSION. As the year 2000 approaches, many Christians are remembering and re-examining Christ's promise of his Second Coming. Joseph Smith and the early Mormons clearly saw the Church's mission as preparing for the Millennium, a thousand years of peace in which Christ will reign personally upon the earth. I address the question, “What is the exact nature of the mission of the restored Church in preparing for Christ's Second Coming?” My answer involves a re-interpretation of the meaning and scope of the Atonement. I argue that the Atonement is not yet complete and explain what still must be accomplished for its fulfillment, including an interpretation of the meaning and nature of Zion. THE ATONEMENT AND THE LAW OF MOSES. Most of the prophets whose words are recorded in our scriptures were working with people who lived under the Law of Moses, and they used it as one of their main tools for helping people to understand Christ. We Latter-day Saints like to think we transcend the law, but not having lived under it, we know only vaguely what we are transcending. Trying to understand Christ without the mediation of the law, we run the risk of not understanding him at all. I try to distinguish two ways of understanding Christ's atonement, one in terms of the Law of Moses and one not.",

    "Presenters": "John D. Caputo",
    "Description": "TOWARD A MESSIANIC POSTMODERNISM: DECONSTRUCTION AND RELIGION Deconstruction is a philosophy that emphasizes the productive role of difference, as opposed to the “modern” or Enlightenment predilection for universality and consensus. There are (at least) two different varieties of this philosophy of difference, depending on which of its two nineteenth-century predecessors, Nietzsche or Kierkegaard, one favors, which I call “Dionysian” and “messianic” postmodernism. Most of the objections that are made against postmodernism have in mind the Dionysian version, but they fall wide of the mark of the messianic version. The line of objections raised against postmodernists, relativism, subjectivism, skepticism, anarchism, antinomianism, anti-institutionalism, nihilism, and despair, takes its lead from the highly Nietzscheanized face of the first version of postmodernism. But as regards the second or messianic version, it is false on its face and very likely betrays the critic's unfamiliarity with the religious and even biblical provenance of a good deal that is going on in deconstruction.",

Society taxes and contributes to make possible our expensive higher educational system because it accepts that academic freedom, despite the discomfort, even anger, it often creates, serves the long-term best interests of society. Societies that have most supported free inquiry and expression have consistently produced the greatest art and literature and also the best long-term solutions to political and social problems. The freedom accorded what Walter Lippmann called the “indispensable opposition” of minority viewpoints consistently produces more truth--and in the long run, more peace--for society. I trace the fortunes of academic freedom in Utah higher education over the past forty years and argue that it is presently greatest, for both Mormons and non- Mormons, not at the University of Utah or BYU but at Utah Valley State College. I explore ways it could and should be expanded elsewhere.",

McKay became church president in 1951 he traveled to South Africa, the first church president to visit that country. While there, he made an important and impromptu change in the church policy regarding ordination of blacks. While not reversing that policy, he significantly changed the procedure for determining whether South Africans had lineage that disqualified them from priesthood ordination. Several years later, in the face of attempts by the church to establish a foothold in Nigeria, he and his counselors gave serious consideration to the possibility of reversing the exclusionary policy. The subject rose again in the context of the American Civil Rights Movement in the mid-and-late 1960's, and appeared headed for resolution in 1969, although this was due to misinterpretation of President McKay's intent. A flurry of activity by important General Authorities in the final months of President McKay's life served first to raise, then to dash the hopes of those who sought a reversal of the policy.",

Since the Book of Mormon clearly states that all sacrifices have their end with Jesus' “great and last” sacrifice, it is puzzling that Joseph Smith would have found such a restoration necessary. The answer to the puzzle lies in the millennial hopes and dreams of the early Mormons and in the restorationist theology of the Burned-over District. Clay's paper will explore that history, examine the eschatological theology behind it, and explain how it was supported in most instances by creative misinterpretation of scripture.",

Following the same path she took as a developing feminist theorist, Cecilia traces the stages in her response to BYU, from consciousness-raising to personal offense at individual oppressors to activism and vigorous (sometimes detached) critique of the systems of oppression.

    "Description": "Pianos & Drums: Taking The Gospel Global. What's Universal? What's Cultural? Lessons From Africa In her forthcoming book (fall 2000), Jan Shipps concludes that the last four decades of correlating and streamlining Church programs, materials, and procedures has resulted in the dislodging of Mormonism from its culture of origin and the transforming of it into a religion that can be applied in many different cultures around the world. Every would-be world religion confronts this challenge; darn few succeed. Pioneer stock Mormons who lament the loss of roadshows and bazaars would get little comfort from the Apostle Paul, who told Jewish Christians the Gentile converts did not have to keep the Jewish feast days and traditions. For him, the testimony of Jesus, becoming a new creation, and the unifying Lord's Supper were the universal demands. And yet, ironically, his epistles give specific, opinionated, instructions to the struggling convert congregations. This same dualism between implementing tested ways and allowing cultural diversity exists as the latter-day Zion spreads abroad. Mormonism's twenty-year engagement in Africa shows how our American-born religion must change to be preached and practiced in every tongue. As this panel reflects on their experiences as Church leaders in Africa, we can glimpse and marvel at the work of the Spirit as Mormonism changes Africans and as Africans change Mormonism. Just what is happening? What are the practical, logistical demands in establishing the Church? What long-held assumptions had to be jettisoned? Who joins? Who stays? What traditional Mormon (American?) ways work? Which don't? What can't be changed? How easy is it to separate the gospel from culture? What about spirituality from culture? Is having one world-wide Church program realistic, or will we eventually delegate and decentralize program development? Even in replacing one culture's arbitrary ways with another's, how much diversity even in cultural things can one Church bear? What challenges have we overcome, and what ones loom on horizon? What might a mature Mormon Church in Africa be like?",

Foundation: Non-Relativistic Ethics Within A Finitistic Theology At this symposium twenty years ago, I took up the challenging question of the grounds of moral obligation in a universe that isn't ultimately founded in God's creative acts. In what sense can He command, and what makes anything right or wrong? A commentator complained that my point of view results in an “antinomian, relativistic ethic.” We were recently both quoted in Richard and Joan Ostling's Mormon America. A revisit is long overdue, both because this vital issue appropriately refuses to die, and because this fear of ethical relativism (combined with the great PR value of Mormonism's image as a bastion of morality) may be one of the enticements tempting many toward “the fleshpots of [modern Christian] orthodoxy.” I argue that, although fundamental LDS beliefs should, indeed, radically recast our understanding of moral law, they do not lead to relativism, properly understood. Indeed, they encourage the sort of personal moral experience that best promotes the kind of moral growth and development that are the purpose and design of our mortal existence.",

This had profound consequences following Joseph's 1844 martyrdom. This paper examines the significance and changes of LDS headquarters culture in Smith's lifetime, in pioneer Utah Mormonism, and in 20th-century Mormonism. I also suggest possible directions for the headquarters culture in the 21st century.

    "Description": "Is Evil Necessary?: Good, Evil, Sin, And The Nature Of Reality with additional paper on Eternal Spirits And The Necessity Of Contingency The prophet Lehi asserted that “it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things.” The opposition between good and evil is often regarded as the fundamental opposition. But if evil were an essential part of reality, if it were necessary, would it not in some sense be good, because good would depend on it? If good and evil were inextricably connected, how could we distinguish between them? I will explore these questions and show that the belief that evil is a necessary part of reality has far-reaching and pernicious consequences. An alternate view of the nature of reality, which sees the feminine- masculine duality as the fundamental opposition in universal reality, will be presented. I will also distinguish sin from evil and argue that while sin is an inevitable part of existence, evil is not. 2nd Abstract- (Dr Huff) I use the work of contemporary philosopher Alvin Plantinga to draw support for the LDS belief that persons exist uncreate. Plantinga presents perhaps the most convincing explanation by a traditional Christian of how there can be evil in the creation of a perfectly good and perfectly powerful creator. However, Plantinga concedes there must be a contingent state of affairs that holds independent of God's will. I argue this concession entails a greater compromise to the classical notion of God's sovereignty than Plantinga admits.",

After sketching Mormon history, with the balance and judgment of long-time Mormon watchers, the authors chronicle the major themes, practices, doctrines, and controversies, of the contemporary LDS--including polygamy, the move from separate kingdom into the American mainstream, the “power pyramid,” forever families and temple secrecy, missionaries, faithful history, Book of Mormon historiography, “Mormons, Inc.,” becoming Gods, dissent, BYU culture wars, and the prospects for the twenty- first century. Incredibly, there was no book that outlined the contours of contemporary Mormonism: Mormon America fills that vital and lucrative niche. Undoubtedly, it will be the primer for the 9,000 journalists who will attend the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, and it may well be the standard, one-volume book on Mormonism for the next decade or two. What do seasoned Mormon insiders think of the book? Here are the opinions of three of the best.",

    "Description": "The Academic Study Of Religion: Prospects And Perils The recent announcement that early steps have been taken toward establishing a Mormon Studies program at Utah Valley State College has generated much excitement among many who have long felt a need for such a program at one of Utah's state schools, but it has also raised concerns on two fronts. Some have begun to worry that such a program could easily become a forum for Mormon apologetics, even proselyting, while others voice concerns about it as “yet another forum for Mormon bashing.” This panel, consisting of UVSC faculty, as well as others with experience studying religion-- including their own--from an academic perspective, will address these and other issues as they consider both the “prospects” and the “perils” of such an adventure.",

These very same techniques, accepted as authoritative in the court room, are applied by science to address the question of humans' nearest relatives in the animal kingdom. The DNA testifies of the continuity with nature and a close relationship between humans and African apes, with a common ancestor as recent as 5-7 mya. Corroborating evidence mounts as an ever- expanding fossil record documents an African origin of hominids and the evolutionary transition to the modern human physical tabernacle. Paper 2 - The Tree Of Life 2- Abstract How can the scientific data, which suggest that we descended from animals that lived and died on this planet for millions of years, be reconciled with the religious perspective that Adam and Eve, the first humans, were immortal? There are two distinct possibilities concerning the nature of their immortality. Either Adam and Eve were created inherently immortal or they were created as mortals and were made immortal by their circumstances within the Garden. If Adam and Eve were inherently immortal, what was the function of the Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden?",

Society taxes and contributes to make possible our expensive higher educational system because it accepts that academic freedom, despite the discomfort, even anger, it often creates, serves the long-term best interests of society. Societies that have most supported free inquiry and expression have consistently produced the greatest art and literature and also the best long-term solutions to political and social problems. The freedom accorded what Walter Lippmann called the “indispensable opposition” of minority viewpoints consistently produces more truth--and in the long run, more peace--for society. I trace the fortunes of academic freedom in Utah higher education over the past forty years and argue that it is presently greatest, for both Mormons and non- Mormons, not at the University of Utah or BYU but at Utah Valley State College.

Matthew Hilton, a local lawyer and conservative activist, assisted the Citizens' group in compiling ten counts of misconduct against Weaver and petitioning the Utah Fourth District Court for summary judgment. Although the Citizens' document is in many ways reflective of national anti-gay prosecution, it also bears highly distinctive marks of Mormon cultural perceptions and anxieties. Hilton's imagery portrays a spectral lesbian sect in a striking inversion of the Mormon institution, complete with secret initiatory rites, a two-by-two missionary force, a female hierarchy of authority, and indications of polygamy. The Citizens' document is, among other things, an artifact of contemporary Mormon culture, an example of one culture's fears of its own projected likeness.",

    "Description": "Orson Scott Card and the Ontology of Redemption This paper will focus on Card's thinking in general, but especially on the philosophically- significant novel, Pastwatch: The Redemption of Christopher Columbus. I will argue that the novel poses, in a profound way, what is entailed in the idea of redemption--and indeed, in the practice and the physics of redemption. Furthermore, the novel develops, in a way that is consistent with others of Card's novels, the materialist orientation of Mormon theology. Finally, a conception of history at work in Pastwatch has more than a little in common with Marx's dialectics.",

The purpose of this paper is to compare the concept of priesthood in these two religious systems and, in particular, to focus the analysis on the way in which these faiths appropriate and interpret the same biblical texts as theological loci.",

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints then launched an effort to transport Mormon culture whole to distant members. This culture bloomed in the 1940s and 50s, gradually receding as church resources were concentrated outside the established stakes and the family was newly emphasized. This paper will be a fond memoir of the days when members trooped to the ward house almost daily for activities and fellowship, before the church retreated from the effort to fill all the needs of the members. The Church was then the place to learn elocution, part-singing, and the tango, a place of extravagant events. As the generations that provided that culture and benefitted from it move on, I want to appreciate those days when “The Glory of God is Intelligence” was interpreted in the widest possible way.",

    "Description": "David O. McKay and the 'Twin Sisters': Free Agency and Tolerance David O. McKay served as church president for nearly two decades and left a positive legacy that continues to enlighten church leaders and members to this day. He was a highly principled man, both in dealing with individuals and in administering the affairs of the church, and the bedrock of his principles was a firm commitment to free agency. The firmness of that commitment was shaped to a large extent by his personal exposure to and aversion to Communism, which he considered to be the antithesis of free agency. However, he realized that other forms of government as well as non-governmental groups and individuals were always at risk of abusing their powers and thus limiting the exercise of free agency among their constituency. A firm commitment to free agency demands an equivalent commitment to tolerance of divergent views and demands action. Using eight case studies, this paper will examine the remarkable extent to which President McKay respected both free agency and tolerance, thus endearing himself to Latter- day Saints across the philosophical spectrum, as well as to a large non-LDS community.",

I argue that spiritual gifts were initially available to lay members of the Mormon church in the 1830s under clerical supervision, and limits evolved during the Kirtland period regarding “appropriate” spiritual manifestations. Women exercised some of the same spiritual gifts as male priesthood holders in conjunction with their work in the Nauvoo Female Relief Society in the 1840s and beyond. I further argue that two factors contributed to the demise of women's spiritual gifts: the gradual clericalization of spiritual gifts and their absorption into priesthood function and the disbanding of the Relief Society in 1844 which had functioned as a nascent parallel to the male priesthood.",

I will explore four interrelated issues: 1) the “grace versus works” question; 2) the question, What would it mean to live as a Christian two thousand years after Jesus (which also gets into what I call “ontological Christianity,” or Christianity seen primarily as a metaphysical system); 3) the idea of the restoration of early Christianity; 4) Mormonism as a commutarian movement.",

And Southern Baptists have issued a formal apology for their racist practices. At the same time, other governments, institutions, and churches have refused to apologize for historic wrongs. Japan has yet to formally apologize for its reign of terror in China, the Australian government refuses to apologize for a century of oppression of its aboriginal peoples, and some churches feel that it is inappropriate to officially seek forgiveness. What responsibility do churches have for past wrongs committed by its leaders and members? Is seeking forgiveness as one recent commentator has said just “quasi-political chic” or an indispensable act in healing and reconciliation?

My move to Sandy resulted in my being submerged into the sea of Mormania. To that time, my contact with “the Church” had been limited to a few open-door meetings with two neatly dressed young men with name badges on their dark suits. Over the years, I have come to learn a lot about the LDS Church, and many times the increased familiarity brought on more than a few chuckles. Between 1958 and 1995, I covered Eastern Europe as a journalist for the Dutch radio and television; from 1984 as a correspondent in Belgrade, the capital of former federal Yugoslavia. My career gave me an intimate knowledge of the communist machine, and upon moving to Utah, I was amazed by the striking similarities between the LDS and communist party rites and habits, in spite of their highly opposite philosophies. My paper will share a few of those similarities, centering on the use by both organizations of group control techniques and symbols.",

    "Description": "A Commentary on Four Past and Present Naturalistic Explanations for Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon Whether one believes that Joseph Smith was a divine prophet, a fraud, or in between, he still had a personality. This personality would have been partly the result of his cultural (American Frontier) background, his family environment, and even his childhood typhoid illness and traumatic surgery. There have been few attempts to understand him psychologically, and virtually none from devout Mormonism, despite the challenge by Jan Shipps more than 20 years ago to solve “the prophet puzzle.” This paper will review four interesting ones, three from outside Mormonism, and one (partly) from within, by Whitsitt (1885), Riley (1902), Brink (1976) and Morain (1998).",

This paper will look at ways in which the actions of the Conference reflect the shift from sect to denomination, with the name change being a symbol of that shift. The conference's focus on issues like gun control and capital punishment, and the School of the Americas (taking liberal political positions on all three issues) is part of that shift. Also, the conference did not take legislative action on two big issues facing us: (1) accepting the baptisms of other denominations and (2) ordination of gays and lesbians; however there were positive signs at the conference on these two issues despite the legislative inaction on them. But there were also signs of continued authoritarianism.",

In fact God is presented as the great example of personality toward which all other persons must strive. If persons other than God are viewed as literal children of God or “gods in embryo” they are also God in microcosm. A Mormon idea of Grace should include not only God's Grace towards us but Grace between all persons. Grace is founded in freedom and is extended toward others.",

Peterson, the man behind the scraggly mustache, who is often clad in--yes--Levi's, fastened with one of those gaudy Western buckles, looks as if he may have stepped out of one of his own fictions, preferably, The Backslider. And when he opens his mouth to a soft, Snowflake, Arizona, drawl, you're sure of it. Over two decades, the novel has moved generations of Mormons and far- flung cultural fellow travelers to mordant laughter and scalding tears. Now, Peterson is laying bare his life in a biography that will scandalize some and reassure others because of its searing honesty.

Saying that God is finite seems to be a very good starting point to solving the problem of evil, on the one hand. But, on the other hand, saying that God's power is limited seems to imply that God's plan might fail. Mormons seem to want to make assertions that imply that God is limited and yet they also want to claim that his power is absolutely sovereign. Just how much power does God have? Is he omnipotent in the traditional sense? Is he all-powerful in some more limited sense? Are we even in a position to judge the nature of God's power?

This presentation will explore the possible impacts of the ready availability of uncorrelated historical research, of Sacrament Meeting talks from around the world, of pornography, or anti-Mormon literature, and of self-defining, and reinforcing communities of affinity and discussion. How are we, both as an institution and as individuals, using the Internet today, and how are our patterns evolving? The relevance and timeliness of this nexus has just been brought into sharp relief by the Church hierarchy's decision to “ask” all wards and stakes to shut down their web sites until further notice. I will propose the beginnings of an outline of research programs we could undertake in exploring this fast-evolving relationship, as church members and leaders respond to the new media and technology.",

Their lives collectively span and illuminate the complex and often turbulent experience of women in the LDS Church. In successive historical contexts (gender, polygamy, activism, and community), their lives raise difficult challenges to understanding Mormon women's experience. I will discuss the dynamic of understanding women of history on their terms, in their times, while asking questions of and about them that are defined by the issues of our day.",

Cynics often fail to believe in the sincerity of any position, and they doubt people are basically good. “Misanthropes” go one step further, distrusting people generally. and doubts that people are good. Both of these views harm us as individuals and they are antithetical to Mormonism. In this presentation, I offer thoughts on the nature of cynicism and how we might counter its negative effects when we find it in ourselves and others.",

Borg shares the results of his research on the historical Jesus. He examines the 'purity system” of the Jewish social world, and contrasts it with revolutionary “politics of compassion” that Jesus taught and practiced. The relevant question for Latter-day Saints is: to what degree (if at all) does adherence to a purity system (such as is taught and practiced within the Church) interfere with the “politics of compassion” and the open social vision that, Borg tells us, were the central concern of Jesus of Nazareth? This paper will explore that question, with perhaps a touch of levity but surely without light-mindedness, as it applies to the behavior and attitudes of the Mormon culture.",

The trial addressed charges of bigamy and criminal nonsupport, with the possibility of a future hearing to air a charge of child rape. The legal battle pitted Juab County attorney David Leavitt, the Utah governor's younger brother, against the gregarious Green and his five wives. Besides revealing the inner workings of a fascinating apostate LDS lifestyle, Green's trial again raises the issues of the legality and possible religious rights relating to polygamy and poses a fascinating duel between church and state.",

    "Description": "Exporting Utah's Theocracy Since 1975: Mormon Organizational Behavior and America's Culture Wars Contrary to most theocracies, Mormon Utah has always required democratic participation for its theocracy. Two major transitions bracketed the twentieth-century manifestation of Utah Mormon theocracy. Beginning in the 1890s, Utah's democratic theocracy had to confront significant political dissent from faithful Mormons and to accommodate non-Mormon political power. By the 1990s, the non-Mormon accommodation persisted, but internal dissent had become politically insignificant. Of greater interest was the process by which LDS headquarters after 1975 exported its democratic theocracy to the nation at large. This required politicizing the Mormon rank-and-file's adoration of the living prophet, claiming that decisions of the hierarchy are without error, appealing to basic fears within the national population, forging political alliances with formerly hostile religious groups, and organizing a permanent LDS network for political activism on national, state, regional, and local levels. The result is that LDS headquarters in Utah can determine the outcome of political votes in states which have less than one percent Mormon population. By any standard, this is an extraordinary development in American politics and society.

Many of us have direct, first-hand knowledge of the 'dark side” of hierarchical organizations - they tend to be rigid, controlling, and inflexible. Yet, a full understanding requires us to acknowledge that there are some things they do well. Indeed, some ask whether they should be changed at all. There are inevitable trade-offs faced by leaders when they strive to balance what are, in many ways, antithetical approaches for structuring their organizations.

    "Description": "Delving into the Mysteries: Argument for an 'Arcana Doctrina' In a Priesthood, Relief Society, and Gospel Doctrine class one hears the often repeated but never supported injunction against 'delving into the mysteries.” Why is the belief in such a prohibition so prevalent in the Church when scripture encourages the study of the mysteries? What does the Greek word, mystery, actually mean? What did it mean to Paul who wrote and spoke in Greek? What did it mean to Joseph Smith and the other early presidents of the Church? What does it mean to modern presidents? Seventeenth-century biblical scholar, Jean Daill'e, coined the term arcana doctrina in reference to secret traditions, which Christ taught only to his Apostles because they were too sacred for the general membership of the primitive Christian church. Daill'e presented evidence that the Apostles later taught these secret traditions to a number of trusted presbyters who taught them in turn, during the post-Apostolic period, to such a select few that these traditions were eventually lost to Christianity. Does the LDS faith possess an arcana doctrina? If so, then where are they taught and who is teaching them? If not, then why does the LDS faith lack what was present in the primitive church as organized by Jesus Christ? I hope to answer these and other questions in my presentation.",

The second section examines more general issues: the confrontation between the federal government and the Church that led to the 'Great Accommodation” by the latter, how a lack of access to the national money supply led to the creation of an elaborate medium of exchange within the Church in the form of promissory notes or tithing scrip, and the Church's uncertain survival in the depths of this financial crisis.

Toward a New Understanding of What It Means To Be “Mormon” What is in a name? . . .Apparently a lot! As recent interviews and official announcements have indicated, as the Church sets sail on its twenty-first century mission, it is signaling that it hopes to lead in determining who is and is not “Mormon” as well as which doctrines and practices from its past it will take into the future. This is a moment at the crossroads. As the Church grows into a truly global religion, the Mormon tent will need to broaden to accommodate members and spiritual styles from different cultures. At the same time, it is moving in a direction that seems to be more restrictive, that strives to project an image of uniformity, that takes pains to define and exclude heresy. This panel discussion will wrestle with these issues, especially focusing on possible ways to re-envision what it means to be “Mormon” that honor the Church's rich and varied past and present, as well as what would be appropriate for the future. Our panelists represent four ways people normally define themselves as Mormon: mainstream Mormon, liberal or cultural Mormon, fundamentalist Mormon, and excommunicated but believing Mormon. Each will first briefly explain their position and claims to be a legitimate member of the Mormon community. Then, through comments and interactions with Jan Shipps and Armand Mauss, participants will explore the possibilities of finding a fifth way: Can a new definition of what it means to be Mormon emerge?

It touches on many things, including faith, integrity ambition, sexuality, and community.

Synopsis: Full of anticipation, Elder Robert Wood packs for his mission. As the great, great grandson of Epaphroditus Wood, the greatest missionary in Church history, Elder Wood believes he, too, will be a powerful instrument in the Lord's hands to call sinners to repentance, work miracles, and convert many to the Truth. However, things do not go as expected, and as he nears the end of his mission, Elder Wood has not baptized a soul. His mission president gives him one last chance to redeem himself before going home. He charges Wood with turning Elder Diaz, an incoming missionary with a troubled past, into a strong member of the Church. Wood tries to inspire his new disciple; however, Diaz's free spirit gets both him and Wood into comical situations, and his probing mind soon has Wood questioning everything he had held sacred. Elder Wood's wrestling finally creates a missionary to make his great, great grandfather, Epaphroditus, proud.",

    "Description": "The Experiences of LDS Women and How Their Culture Influences Manifestations of Their Sexuality This presentation is a progress report on the data I have collected so far in my research on the sexuality of Mormon women, ages thirty through fifty. It contains both quantitative and qualitative analyses, and I will include several findings that have caught me somewhat by surprise. In particular, I have begun to note differences in attitudes towards sexuality in women who were raised LDS, yet taken to church by relatives and friends, in contrast to attitudes of those who had a more traditional Mormon upbringing. I have also found striking some remarks made by women about how much of the language used to describe sex and intimacy, especially when they were teenagers, has negatively affected their feelings about their own sexuality.",

    "Description": "'Re-establishing the Restoration' Far from solving the Church's problems, the Manifesto introduced another set of difficulties which came to head in the early twentieth century. I will discuss these problems in terms of two crises. First, the Church's negative reputation was inhibiting its ability to accomplish its objectives at home and abroad. Second, the internal consequences of the Manifesto which surfaced during President Smith's administration were undermining the faith of its members. The unmistakable vitality of the LDS Church today is in large part due to Joseph F. Smith's response to these crises and constitute a prophetic re-establishment of the restoration by him.",

What do the scriptures, Joseph Smith, and other early Church leaders teach about the grand design and purposes of God's non-human creations? Does having “dominion” over the kingdom of creatures mean we are their predators and exploiters or does it suggest a “stewardship” relationship in which we become their caretakers in order to help them “fulfill the full measure of their creation?” If the scriptures teach, “woe be unto man that sheddeth blood or wasteth flesh and have no need,” and “the blood of every beast will I require at your hands,” what rationale could be used to explain Church-owned, revenue-generating enterprises such as Deseret Land and Livestock and the Westlake Hunting Preserve? Do these operations constitute sacrificing principle for profit?",

Though expecting a massive influx of people, Church agents there were under-funded and overworked, with preparations beginning too late. The tremendous task of outfitting and providing handcarts for some two thousand Saints expecting to journey to Zion that season virtually overwhelmed them. The resultant delays disappointed the travelers and made more than a thousand dangerously late in beginning the trek.",

    "Description": "Reconciling the Utah Tax Code with LDS Scripture: 'Equality' vs. the Income Gap Latter-day revelation states that 'it is not given that one man should possess that which is above another” (D&C 49:20). And the Book of Mormon instructs us to freely impart of our substance to the poor (Mosiah 4:16-21), even to the extent that they are economically equal with us (Jacob 2:17). Despite all this, Utah's majority LDS legislature maintains a tax code that is highly regressive, favoring big business and the rich over the poor. This paper takes a look at the political legacy that may have caused this economic policy, and at the viewpoints of LDS members and state legislators on the subject. It then makes a case for a critical look at Utah's political establishment regarding economic policy and the phenomenon among LDS voters to support that establishment.",

Religions profoundly affect the ways in which people view their sexuality and how they express it in their lives. Mormon theology has several fundamental teachings which promote a positive view of sexuality and sexual relations, but the Church also has practices and teachings which often have a negative influence on people's sexual lives. Although Mormon theology teaches that sex is eternal and fundamentally good, Mormons experience all the sexual problems that humanity is heir to. This panel explores the ways in which LDS teachings and culture affect members' sexuality, sexual beliefs, and behavior. It especially focuses on the question: 'How can Mormons meet their sexual needs in positive, responsible, and ethical ways?” Sponsor: Mormon Women's Forum",

While the practice of a committee imposing a creedal statement of belief on a congregation is anathema to Mormons, the use of the literary form of the creed by individuals is a helpful spiritual discipline. It forces one to confront the questions, 'Just what do I believe?” and “What are the issues, ideas, and concepts that animate my religious life?” The sharing of these core religious doctrines and ideas from one person's life inspires others.",

But the images are still as vivid as the lessons that continue to echo. Between September 1981 and May 1983, twenty-nine issues of the Press wrestled with conformity and dissent, scholarship and faith, answers and questions--engaging tensions in print as they played in people themselves. One hundred photographic slides capture moments recalling this unusual experiment in student publishing and Mormon studies. Snapshots reveal a skeleton crew of full-time volunteers, obsessed with a cause and surprised by what it enabled them to do.

It will also focus on his primary identity as a teacher, (and we'll force him to discuss his impact on the wider scholarly world.) Finally, it will turn to his Mormon identity, especially his BYU years and youthful hope to liberalize Mormonism from within.

This session offers a historical and legal perspective on pertinent constitutional arguments, and tries to predict their future success with the Supreme Court. The (ironic) conclusion: Fundamentalist Mormons can expect constitutional protection when the court extends the line of Griswold v. Connecticut (legalizing birth control) and Roe v. Wade (legalizing abortion) to encompass homosexual relationships. No legal education will be presupposed, and I invite questions and participation from the audience.",

Death is often portrayed as a 'gateway” to the next life, a necessary step in the plan of eternal progression. However, this approach overlooks many profound life lessons we might learn and experience through giving serious contemplation and consideration to death, including our own mortality. In this paper, I contrast the ritualization of death in LDS culture with experiential reflection on death as developed by two thinkers, the Danish existentialist theologian Soren Kierkegaard and the contemporary philosopher Herbert Fingarette. I argue that we can come to understand a lesson of universal importance voiced by Kierkegaard, that learning to die well is the highest wisdom of life.",

Even though the First Amendment to the Constitution legally uncoupled the church and the civil government in the United States, a strong scholarly case has been made that a powerful de facto Protestant establishment remained in place for well over a century. This paper will show that the establishment pattern lingered on for generations, but will contend that it was particularly persistent in the nation's cities where establishments were not always Protestant. Showing that practically all of these virtual establishments withered away during the 20th century, the paper will argue that while its consequences are more visible in the culture than in economics and politics, a de facto establishment is alive and well in Salt Lake City.",

In this paper, I argue that the absolute spiritual and moral certainty and unquestioning obedience to authority held up as the standard for faithful, worthy members has led us to a dead end of self-righteous complacency. This parochial attitude is a betrayal of our liberal roots and an offense to our neighbors.

    "Description": "Why Mormons Should Celebrate Holy Week The week between Jesus' triumphant entry into Jerusalem and his triumphant resurrection from the dead is the most significant week in human history. Beginning with the early church, Christians celebrated the events of this week and for two millennia they have been the focus of annual celebrations of what has been called the Passion of our Lord, Jesus Christ. Beginning with Palm Sunday and moving through Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Holy Saturday, Christians throughout the world mark the last great events in Christ's life. All of these holy days lead us to the great drama of Easter Sunday when the angel rolled back the stone from the tomb and said to his disciples, 'He is not here, for he is risen.” Latter-day Saints celebrate the last of these holy days, but not the others, and yet there is no doctrinal reason why we cannot join with other Christians in offering our devotions throughout this week. His presentation offers an historical overview of Holy Week and presents the case that Latter-day Saints, especially with the Church's new emphasis on being the Church of Jesus Christ, should join with other Christians in making this an annual holy festival.",

The atoning sacrifice of Christ makes it possible for us to be reconciled with God; without the Atonement all humanity would be lost and in bondage to sin, death, and the devil. The Atonement is necessary for salvation. Why is it necessary and why does it bring about salvation? Some theories of the Atonement raise difficulties that seem more problematic than the questions they are meant to answer. If God is merciful, why does he require a sacrifice for sin? Why can't he just forgive us? If Christ is punished for our sins, how does this satisfy justice? If Jesus' death is necessary, is it a good or a bad thing? Are the perpetrators of it sinners or do they fulfill God's will? Does the Atonement exalt suffering and in some way justify abuse? In this paper I will explore these questions, seeking an understanding of the Atonement that is grounded in God's love and shows how this love works to bring about freedom from sin, death, and oppressive powers.",

    "Description": "The Spirituality of Generation X It is always difficult to define what makes a 'generation.” The very term itself asks for a chronological answer; yet, when we discuss a generation, we are most often asking cultural questions. What characteristics do a group of people born within an approximate twenty-four year span share with each other? What events or societal trends have helped shape their experience? Do they have in common certain assumptions about life? The term “Generation X” has been applied to the post-boomer generation that most social scientists agree to as referring to those born from the early 1960s to early 1980s. Sometimes referred to derogatorily as a “generation adrift” or even a “slacker” generation because of what appears to some as an apathetic attitude (in comparison to the idealism of the young adults of the 1960s), it is nevertheless a generation with a deep spirituality that is simply different from that of their parents. There is much talk about the “graying” of the Sunstone crowd. It is therefore very important to listen to members of this younger generation tell of their own spiritual journeys.",

    "Description": "Defending Magic: Explaining The Necessity of Ordinances On their face, ordinances seem to be morally insignificant gestures that have meaning only insofar as they are symbolic. But, then, why would they be necessary for salvation? We will explore at least four separate theories, but I will argue that these theories are either (1) quite plausible, but do not explain the necessity of ordinances, or (2) adequately explain the necessity of ordinances, but fail the plausibility test. Two of these theories will receive special attention: the 'psychological theory” which argues that ordinances affect our state of mind so as to make us more likely to do what is right, and the “contract theory” which suggests that ordinances are primarily the beginning of a contract between ourselves and God.

    "Description": "Trailing Clouds of Glory and Lifting the Veil: A Pre-mortal/Past-life Primer The LDS church is one of the few Christian religions that teaches the doctrine of premortal learning experiences (D&C 138:56). Anecdotal evidence for pre-birth learning experiences is increasing in the fields of psychology and psychiatry. Remarkably, many of these learning experiences are reported to occur in connection with actual events and lives previously lived on this earth. Even the American Psychological Association has acknowledged the existence of 'past-life memory.” How does this phenomena present itself, how prevalent it is, and what are some theories for its existence? Can multiple earth experiences be reconciled with LDS doctrine? How are we benefited by considering our own pre-birth learning experiences?",

It was established to grow cotton, anchor the outskirts of Zion, and explore possible navigation of the Colorado River. It couldn't last. Living conditions were extremely difficult, including taming the Muddy. The cotton market collapsed after the Civil War. The Nevada border was shifted eastward (moving the mission out of Utah entirely). Nevada demanded that taxes be paid in gold, something impossible for settlers in a desert. After all of these setbacks, Brigham Young finally recommended these pioneers go elsewhere. Most of them went to Long Valley in southeastern Utah where they founded Orderville, the most successful of the United Orders.",

In this session, panel members will trace the history of the controversy, but, more importantly, they will try to clarify questions about what it means to say that Sunstone is striving to be an “open forum.” Does this mean that Sunstone should have an “open mike” where anyone can say anything? If so, what are the possible consequences to the organization as the sponsor of such a gathering? If not, what standards in terms of scholarship, topic, and tone are, or should be applied, when considering proposals for symposiums? How should these decisions be made and by whom?

Or, Can a Mormon Be a Buddhist?: How Might Latter-day Saints Think of the Other Religions Recent discussions of the plurality of religions have centered around three possible stances toward another's religion. We can be exclusivists claiming that our tradition is the only true one and that all others are wrong. Any investigation of the other is only to show how it is wrong or it is whoreing after false gods. We can be an inclusivist claiming that all religions are really versions of our own, which is the true faith. Or we can be pluralists and claim that all religions are somehow true, that they are examples of a transcendent truth that is beyond the finite expression of any one faith, or perhaps that different religions may represent different truths. In this paper, I use the metaphor of marriage to indicate problems with each of these positions. I find Mormons that fit into all three.",

    "Description": "Mormon Criminal Element in Nauvoo: The Multi-Faceted Tragedy of the Hodge Brothers There is a strong tendency to idealize “the Nauvoo period” of Mormon history. What is often overlooked is that Nauvoo was still a frontier town, prone to many of the same struggles facing all settlements of this period. One of these struggles was crime, and not all Nauvoo criminals were Gentiles. Using the brutal murders of a Mennonite minister and his son-in-law by two Mormon brothers, William and Stephen Hodge, as a springboard, this paper explores the issue of the Mormon criminal element in Nauvoo. In exploring the tragedy of these murders and the subsequent trial, hangings, and newspaper coverage of the Hodge saga, we gain a deeper understanding of frontier Nauvoo in the year immediately following the death of Joseph Smith. The story of crime in Nauvoo reaches into the struggle between Brigham Young and William Smith for control of the Church; it highlights the mindset in which every murder was seen as evidence of the plottings of “secret combinations”; and it raises questions about the role of Hosea Stout and the Nauvoo police in possible incidents of “blood atonement.”",

Thus, in their eyes, the conflict is 'Christ versus culture.” This paper argues that this question does indeed involve a conflict between “Christ and culture,” but asks if the defenders of tradition might have it backwards. Looking at the totality of Jesus Christ's teachings, might not one argue that homosexuals are accepted in God's sight on an equal basis with heterosexuals? Might not those passages in the Bible which treat homosexuality as evil be treated as the influence of ancient Israelite culture, in the same way many read cultural influences in the biblical writings which condone slavery and polygamy and assume a patriarchal social order which today we would all deplore as immoral?",

Husband/father as a universal role for men is woven into the fabric of the Proclamation on the Family. Drawing on Blankenhorn's research, I will explore this role. As set forth in the Proclamation on the Family, the husband/father role informs tradition, practice, and policy, including male-only priesthood ordination, the “forever family,” the Church's recent defense of the Boy Scouts of America in the lawsuit concerning gay scout leaders, and opposition to same-sex unions.",

One of the reasons the book is significant is that the authors have chosen to put their names on the work. In so doing, they become, by default, become some of the very few public faces of plural marriage, interviewing with countless reporters and publications. They have also recently helped push through changes in Utah family law. At a time when the term 'fundamentalist Mormon” is being treated by many as an oxymoron, these women are challenging stereotypes and general perceptions about those of Mormon heritage who still practice this principle. Each panelist will speak on a different aspect of plural marriage. There will also be ample opportunity to ask questions.",

They will focus on two basic factors: (1) a retrospective overview of the motives of and methods and processes utilized by each author in pursuing this elusive, often controversial topic; (2) a brief 'progress report” on scholarly research/writing on this issue done over the past twenty to thirty years.",

    "Description": "The Use and Abuse of Chiasmus in Book of Mormon Studies This paper will demonstrate that simple Hebraic-type chiasmus does not exist in the Book of Mormon except in rare instances, but that there is a natural explanation for these occurrences. This paper will also examine longer, more complex chiasms. Applying the criteria of a growing number of Bible scholars to the complex Book of Mormon chiasms proposed by John W. Welch and Donald W. Parry, I will demonstrate that the vase majority depart from what the chiasmists themselves call 'symmetrical parallelism.” Most exhibit imbalance, asymmetry, questionable demarcation, mixed parallel styles, and arbitrary omission and inclusion of key elements. Additionally, many proposed examples ignore and disrupt more dominant literary patterns and serve no discernable literary purpose. Even if we allow for the possibility that complex chiasmus might occasionally appear in the Book of Mormon, the multitude of near-misses points to what statisticians call the fallacy of the enumeration of favorable circumstances, or emphasizing the successes while disregarding the failures.",

Some of these include: thinking they can no longer be an eternal family; feeling the gay or lesbian parent can no longer be a role model; perceiving the parent as a sinner; and wondering if they might be gay themselves. When LDS children have to deal with these issues they often become depressed (even suicidal) or may become inactive in the Church. This panel will share their own experiences and concerns, making suggestions to eliminate ignorance and fear. There will be time for questions and answers.",

Most return home strengthened in their beliefs and identity as Latter-day Saints. But some do not. This time of testing therefore involves real threats to identity that are linked to separation from home, encounters with alien cultures and alternative faiths, and challenges to personal and interpersonal beliefs about oneself. In order to cope with these threats, the Church, mission authorities, and the missionaries themselves construct strategies against the threats they perceive as a means of coping with them. These threats and coping strategies will be examined using interviews personal journals and institutional records, including the film 'God's Army.”",

    "Description": "Because 'No Bell in Us Tolls': Imagining A More Explicit Pragmatism in Mormon Thought many observers have noted in passing that Mormonism is a very 'pragmatic” religion, but as they use the term they usually don't mean much beyond “practical.” While I agree that this is a fair characterization of various aspects of LDS thought and praxis, there is much more to the philosophical tradition of pragmatism that just a common-sense approach to issues and questions. Pragmatism honors individual temperaments while calling us to adventure and a robust engagement with life. Yet, it also contains strong correctives that are especially useful as we find ourselves occasionally spiraling off into universes of our own making or riding too enthusiastically on our own elegant but narrowly focused hobby-horses. If it were understood better and its criteria for judging truths were more explicitly applied, it could be demonstrated that we-individually and within our tradition-would greatly benefit from this international application of pragmatis.",

There are several indications that the Vision was an out-of-body experience. Once the Vision is framed as such, we can then apply what we know about out-of-body experiences to our interpretation of the Vision and greatly expand our understanding of it. Primarily, we discover a state of consciousness that is very responsive to the projection of inner beliefs as objective perception. Data about out-of-body experience is methodologically validated.",

This doctrine, somewhat less frequently, may also be invoked in Word of Wisdom discussions. Finally, Primary lessons may note that coming to the earth to obtain a body is a major purpose of this life and necessary to progression. De we, as member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as Christians, or even as humans, do ourselves a disservice by limiting this discussion rather than exploring the connections between our bodies and our spiritual lives? This session considers physical, emotional, and spiritual connections, posits that better understanding of our own bodies can help spiritual growth, and throws out random thoughts and questions on what still remains much of a mystery to the author.",

Can it be that, as the Church encounters more and more diverse souls, it, in institutional reflex, turns tradition into doctrine and fable into dogma? Can it be that we are establishing 'infallibility” where there should be only searching? I spent twenty years as a professional sinner - Joseph spent only ten. So what's the problem?",

The question of whether BSA could exclude homosexuals from adult membership was resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court in BSA's favor. However, the Court's 5-4 decision raised more questions for Scouters than it answered. For example, can (or should) a celibate homosexual Mormon serve as a BSA volunteer? This session begins with a brief presentation of the Supreme Court decision, followed by a discussion of how it affects Scouting carried out by BSA's largest sponsor organization, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.",

Opposition to gay rights initiatives is often based on religious belief that homosexuality is sinful. This is true for the Mormon Church that has been in the forefront of efforts to fight gay marriage and civil rights. Since this is a faith-based social policy, it could be enlightening to understand the scriptural basis of this strongly held Mormon stand against homosexuality. What are the teachings in the uniquely Mormon scriptures that support the position of the Church? This presentation will undertake a statistical analysis of Mormon scriptures to identify verses relating to homosexuality and a context analysis of these verses.",

The Role of Visual Image in Belief If immediate impressions of God the Father's countenance, hair color, age, race, voice, wardrobe, or dwelling place come to mind, chances are good that Michelangelo, Charlton Heston, or an Ensign illustration helped put those images into your head. History has proven that there is great power in religious images to clarify, teach, enlighten, comfort, confuse, mislead, and deeply offend. Such poser was especially present for early Christianity’s illiterate membership, but religious images clearly continue to impact even the very educated today. By focusing on popular portrayals, of the Father - from Renaissance masterpieces to 20th century cinema to LDS depictions of the The First Vision - this session will examine the evolution of traditional Christian and Mormon thought about who God is and how we fit into the picture.",

    "Presenters": "William D. Russell, L. Kay Gillespie",
    "Description": "SL02112,  As a faith community becomes successful in ways the world measures success, it becomes easy for its members to live in a relatively low state of tension with the surrounding culture. As part of the “get tough on crime” attitude common in the culture today, the majority of Americans favor the death penalty for the most serious crimes. I argue that capital punishment is both immoral and impractical, and it should be opposed on both religious and secular grounds by Christians, including those of us who also call ourselves Saints.",

    "Description": "SL02113, The variations among First Vision accounts have always attracted our attention. Initially, this was due to the polemical tendencies of early studies of Mormon origins, which tried to disprove the veracity of Smith's experience. Later inquiries were driven by historians who sought to discover the causal reasons for Mormonism's appearance on the American religious scene. This paper will approach the First Vision accounts as conversion stories, with variations seen as indicators of shifts within Smith's own worldview.",

This study also shows it to be unlikely that the priesthood was part of ancient Israel's religious practices until the time of the Exodus, nor, apparently, were priests part of early Christian leadership for some two-hundred years. These findings open the door to a wider interpretation about who has authority to speak and act in the name of God.",

    "Description": "SL02121, The term “Generation X” has been applied to the group of young adults now entering their mid-twenties to early forties. Coming of age after the highly idealistic 1960s but in the midst of the information revolution and a tremendous boom in popculture, this generation has proven difficult t ounderstand, especially with regard to faith and religiosity. To many, they seem to be a “generation adrift,” constantly searching but never quite finding the kind of secure home within church and institutiona lsettings as did many of their parents. Does this mean “Gen Xers” are not religious? Do they“lack faith”? Or is the iconoclasm and irreverence of much of today's pop culture a manifestation of a different kind of faith, a different set of needs that perhaps require a new syncretic form of spirituality? What can faith traditions do to attract and develop strong ties with members of this generation?James W. Fowler will reflect on these and other matters related to Generation X from sociological and experiential perspectives, correlating them reflectively with his own work in faith development theory.",

    "Description": "SL02122, In the modern movie lexicon, the term 'chick flick” has achieved a recent, rampant popularity. Aside from its inherent condescension, its primary difficulty is the implication that men and women are naturally and universally attracted to very different kinds of movies. Actually, the mass marketers of pop trash pictures have become the new Hollywood tastemakers by influencing manufacture of similar formula fare for both sexes, although separately targeted to male and female audiences. “Dick flicks,” meanwhile, represents the egregious double standard of screen nudity where the penis is virtually never visible yet wields a disproportionate ghostly influence. (In the genre archetype, the 1986 Reagan-era war propaganda film, Top Gun, America's patriotic flyboys get erections going into battle.) This paper will discuss modern films that smash stereotypes and increase our understanding of gender while expanding a sense of community between men and women, as in two remarkable personal documentaries, Kate Davis's Southern Comfort and Utahan Paul Larsen's Chasing a Good Day to Die. Among other films examined are What Women Want, Ocean's 11, The Sweetest Thing, Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, The Importance of Being Earnest, My First Mister, I Am Sam, Kissing Jessica Stein, and The Son's Room.",

Told primarily through the eyes of Joseph Lyman Jessop, a polygamist sent to Short Creek to help build “a branch of the Kingdom of God,” this story explores behind-the-scenes reasons this “refuge” so quickly, within three months' time, became such a focal point for Church, state, and national scrutiny.

    "Description": "SL02221, Carol Gnade's remarkable journey from Wisconsin to the center of many of Utah's recent civil liberties battles began when, on a Utah skiing vacation, she chanced to hear a news report about how the Utah state legislature had just outlawed abortions for any reason. Surprised, she called the local ACLU office to ask if they could use a volunteer and, before long, became the chapter's director of development and then executive director. This past April, she announced her retirement, effective at the end of 2002. Among other cases, Gnade has guided ACLU campaigns regarding the sale of a block of Salt Lake City's Main Street to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; equal access for the Gay/Straight Alliance, a student club at a Salt Lake City high school; the case of Wendy Weaver, an educator who was told she couldn't speak truthfully about who she is when it was learned (in a conversation outside of the classroom) that she is a lesbian; and she has also worked behind the scenes with four Utah executions. We know you will enjoy meeting Carol and hearing her reflect on her extraordinary experiences trying to safeguard individual freedoms in this most interesting and church-dominated state.",

Still, of all the theological challenges that dominate philosophy of religion, “theodicy,” often called the “problem of evil,” seems in the minds of many Latter-day Saints to be less troubling than it is for more traditional theistic traditions. Why is this so? In this follow-up session to one presented at last year's symposium, panelists will examine LDS approaches to the problem of evil in conversation with the work of “process theologians,” thinkers who are working to apply the seminal insights of Alfred North Whitehead to religious questions and themes. What can Latter-day Saints learn from the work of process theologians? Can we develop our theological first principles to match the sophistication of their analyses and proposed solutions? Where might Mormon approaches to theodicy be stronger? Can the problem of evil ever be “solved”?",

    "Description": "SL02277, A recent book, More Than One: A Sacred Heritage, A Promise for Tomorrow, by Shane Whelan, has initiated a new conversation among faithful Latter-day Saints about the practice of plural marriage. Most studies of Mormon polygamy have focused on its history and scope, have been sociological treatises about its contemporary practice among fundamentalist Mormons, or have been written from advocacy positions either praising or condemning its many forms. Whelan's book is different, for he writes from a confessional position as an active Latter-day Saint who believes that polygamy is a “true and pure principle that will once again be practiced among the Saints as part of the restoration of the fullness of the gospel and in preparation for the Savior's Second Coming.” Whelan adds caveats, of course: it should only be resumed when it is no longer against the law of the land and only when the Lord commands its reinstatement through the Church's recognized prophet. Is plural marriage as Whelan sees it? It is true that the Church has never condemned the principle, only its practice, but does that mean plural marriage is an eternal law? Will Latter-day Saints from this or future generations, like those in earlier times, be called upon to live “the Principle”? Is plural marriage a requirement for exaltation in the celestial kingdom, or was it a commandment only for nineteenth-century Saints? Are the doctrines and justifications given for the earlier practice of polygamy valid? Hear our panelists, and consider what you might say or do if Church members are once more encouraged to enter into the practice!",

    "Description": "SL02312, The assertion that there are two ultimates provides a basis for dialogue between two basic kinds of religious experience: the experience of the ultimate in a personal and impersonal form. I think this notion of two ultimates is a particularly fruitful one for theological interpretations of LDS doctrine, with its emphasis on freedom and persons. In this respect, it may be that the LDS notion of God bears a resemblance to Mahayana Buddhist understanding of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas as human beings who have become perfect through their compassion for suffering creatures. I argue further that it may be more helpful for Latter-day Saint theologians and philosophers to look to other traditions for help in interpreting Mormon revelation than to look solely to the theistic tradition which has often been hostile to anything like LDS theism.",

This paper compares Joseph's differing versions of the creation story, first with one another, and then with the text of Genesis as it existed at the time of Jesus, as witnessed by the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Samaritan Pentateuch, and the Greek Septuagint.

    "Presenters": "Robert A. Rees, Janet Brigham Rands",
    "Description": "SW03035, For several years, I’ve been examining various challenges to Joseph Smith’s claim that he translated the Book of Mormon through the gift and power of God. In this third installment, I examine the theory some naturalist critics have turned to as a more rational explanation: that it was the product of “automatic” or “spirit” writing, similar to  the processes said to have produced such works as the Course in Miracles and the Urantia Book. In this paper, I examine the Book of Mormon in relation to the phenomenon  of automatic writing as well as new scientific explorations of communication from the spirit world.",

These changes  make for a fascinating study of the reflexive nature of Church doctrine and theology as Latter-day Saints and their leaders meet the world.",

It is interesting to discover that he has had this gift since he was a teenager. Further, perhaps there is something for us to learn from Hugh's style of criticism: He has never been censured for his sometimes-biting words about the Mormon community. And although his influence has not been universally embraced by the Church, it has been deeply felt by many.",

Mormonism emerged in the nineteenth century primarily as a liberal religion. This tradition in Mormonism has been strong but has coexisted also with strong conservative elements. Recently, however, Mormonism has clearly become more identified with conservative religious elements that emphasize belief in an all-powerful God, distrust human nature, and value authority as the source of religious knowledge. As a Mormon raised in the liberal tradition, I chronicle this transformation through my personal experience and propose a religious stance and course of action that might resurrect and advance Mormonisms liberal religious tradition.",

For others, the call of Christianity---that we love our neighbors as ourselves and even learn to love (not kill) our enemies---takes center stage in their reasoning.

It is well known that  the Wood's Museum owned two of the mummies formerly owned by Joseph Smith, as well as a portion of the Egyptian papyri associated with the Book of Abraham that was not part of the discovery at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1967.

It also marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the revelation reversing The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’ policy of denying priesthood and temple blessings to its members of black African descent. Dr. King envisioned a “beloved community” as a realistic, achievable goal in which there is  no poverty, hunger, homelessness, nor racism, for in this community, all forms of discrimination, bigotry, and prejudice are replaced by an all-inclusive spirit of sisterhood and brotherhood. Latter-day Saints speak of the achievable goal of Zion in which all are “of one heart and one mind, . . .

It also marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the revelation reversing The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’ policy of denying priesthood and temple blessings to its members of black African descent. Dr. King envisioned a “beloved community” as a realistic, achievable goal in which there is  no poverty, hunger, homelessness, nor racism, for in this community, all forms of discrimination, bigotry, and prejudice are replaced by an all-inclusive spirit of sisterhood and brotherhood. Latter-day Saints speak of the achievable goal of Zion in which all are “of one heart and one mind, . . .

The man for all seasons, author of Utopia, Sir Thomas More defended Catholicism and attacked Lutheran heretic William Tyndale, the brilliant linguist who single-handedly translated most of the Bible. Interestingly, many of their topics are the very issues many Latter-day Saints still discuss with passion: the true church, apostasy, continuous revelation, closed vs. open scriptures, faith vs. works, free agency, what is a testimony, women and the priesthood, church discipline, obedience and dissent.",

When Charles Whitney, Helen’s teenage son, shot himself in 1886, Helen again recorded the event in detail in her journal, a harrowing few pages. Almost as traumatic to Helen was her daughter Gen’s marriage to a non-Mormon later that year. In both these events, Helen grappled with existential agony, then tried to make sense of the experience through her perception of the gospel.",

    "Description": "SW04074, Last fall, I wrote an essay, published in Sunstone, that detailed my struggle for testimony. In it, I discuss how my desire for truth led me into the dark side of Church history, causing a battle between my  intellect and my spiritual ties to the Church. I also discuss how I’ve been affected by the dishonest dealings of some Church leaders concerning the Mark Hofmann bombings, which claimed the life of my father,  Steve Christensen. Despite the “costs” of writing that essay, the blessings that have come are far greater. In this session, I discuss the pros and cons of opening up to those around me, including my experience  with being made a scapegoat and used as a negative example to my missionary peers in the Ohio Columbus Mission.      SW04074, Mormons are expected to gain a “testimony” of the unique religious tenets of the Church. This expectation is so prevalent that those not able to testify to having such “knowledge” inevitably feel marginalized, unworthy, and suspect in the eyes of believers. One peculiar response to this expectation has  been the creation of a group of Mormons I call “closet doubters,” active members of the Church who either pretend to “know,” or who remain silent and secretive about their plight. In this session, we will explore the reasons for this curiosity and the problems that confront closet doubters. I particularly invite those from faiths other than Mormonism to share their experiences. Does a similar phenomenon arise in other traditions?",

This presentation draws on my experience as the editor of his journals covering the period from 1880 to 1898.

Although some scholars have dismissed the tribes' ancestral claims, new DNA evidence has confirmed their descent from the house of Israel, including possession of the priestly Cohanim gene.

How does LDS psychopathology differ from that of non-LDS persons? What roles have feminist dissent and LDS philosophies of sexuality played in defining the discipline?",

    "Presenters": "Jennifer Chandler Jones, Kerry Shirts",
    "Description": "SL04153, Deep within human consciousness and throughout mythology, we observe the earth symbolizing the feminine energy of the cosmos. In much of the world, human beings have inherited a mythology that promotes men's authority and dominance over the earth and over women. This core belief has left a legacy in which women are subjugated and our planet is being destroyed. As we enter the 21st century, we are at a critical time where we must consider a new respect for the feminine. Our planet will not survive if the belief in power and domination continues. We must embrace a mythology that pro-motes and encourages a new awareness of unity, equality, and harmony.",

Roberts,” but Chamberlin is largely forgotten, and his work can be found only in the special collections sections of university libraries. Chamberlin was a personalist philosopher who believed that the person was the ultimate category of reality. He studied at California and Harvard with George Holmes Howison and Josiah Royce, two of the most important American philosophers of the age. This paper focuses on Chamberlin's interpretations of Doctrine and Covenants 88, 93, and 130 to consider his idea of God as the community of persons with the Father and Mother at its head.",

If David O. McKay and Emma Rae Riggs McKay were models of “eternal sweethearts” and “romance in marriage,” the Hinckley marriage, as portrayed in the media, modeled an effective partnership of somewhat overlapping but largely separate spheres. Other sources to show the social representations of desired womanhood will be addresses by members of the First Presidency to the Young Women and Relief Society in their annual broadcasts and obituaries of Mormon women printed for a four-week period shortly after Sister Hinckley's funeral",

During Smith's eighteen-year tenure, the RLDS Church trans-formed from a sect to a denomination. This shift can be seen in five innovations that occurred through his leadership. Best known is the ordination of women, which began 17 November 1985. But four other changes were part of the shift he orchestrated: construction of the temple in Independence, Missouri, during his tenure and its subsequent dedication to the pursuit of peace; the shift from closed to open communion; the appointment of a non-Smith as his successor; and finally, the idea of changing the church's name to the “Community of Christ.” What forces shaped this dynamic leader?",

Jesus.” This is Zed speaking, short for “Zedekiah,” one of three Nephite apostles who Christ promised could minister to the earth's inhabitants continuously until the second coming. In this monologue, we learn that after 2,000 years, Zed, the third of the American trinity, is restless. He had been sidetracked by the theater, where, unlike his own existence, people's stories actually have endings, and feels estranged from the other two Nephites who share his charge. Recounting the history of his early life as a translator of records in ancient Zarahemla, followed by his special calling, the neurotic Zed takes us on a provocative journey from the nineteenth-century American stage to the gold mines of the Sierra Nevada, from the dusty home of a polygamous wife in Utah Territory to the horrors of the 1911 Triangle Fire in New York City. Ultimately a meditation on immortality, Zed's “voice from the dust” humorously and poignantly addresses human frailty and the contingent nature of religious texts.",

And, understandably, some are struggling. “This isn't what I've been taught all these years!” “That doesn't seem to mesh with past prophetic utterances.” “Does this mean I'm not really a Lamanite descendent?” This is an important time in our tradition's history.

Using examples from classroom presentations, journal responses, and personal projects of the various LDS and non-LDS students in the course, we hope to illuminate some of the unique challenges of teaching Mormonism in a very large public university (especially one located in a secondary Mormon cultural region).

They assume that sin is primarily an action carried out by an individual and for which that individual is alone responsible. I argue that individual sin is the exception and that collective sin is the norm. My arguments are based on considerations dealing with the nature of individual and collective action, moral luck, and responsibility. This theology of collective sin also yields up a communitarian notion of grace in which each participant of the community of God is equal and interdependent with the others, including God. Moreover, this theology of sin and grace roundly condemns modern manifestations of political liberalism and prescribes a society that is radically egalitarian.",

The messenger said the gold in this hill was to provide relief to the Church and the U.S. government after a severe economic collapse. As Koyle's revelatory experiences and flair for prophecy became more dramatic, LDS authorities pressured Koyle and his followers to abandon the Relief Mine, as it was known. In 1913, at the Church's request, noted geologist/ Apostle James E. Talmage investigated the Relief Mine, ultimately declaring that no gold would ever be found there. For years, a battle ensued between supporters of Talmage and Koyle regarding the mine's efficacy. The 1913 First Presidency statement “A Warning Voice” was an outgrowth of this controversy, the document comprising a quasi-scriptural refutation of mining ventures and revelations coming from other than authorized sources. This paper will examine the history behind the conflict, accounts of Bishop Koyles' various prophecies, and some lesser-known writings from Talmage's journals.",

Through an engagement with LDS primary sources and Douglas Davies's Introduction to Mormonism, as the course developed, the students developed a more nuanced understanding of the similarities and differences between the LDS and Catholic traditions, an understanding that framed the students' critique of John Krakauer's treatment of Latter-day Saints in his Under the Banner of Heaven",

    "Description": "SL04255, May Swenson, Utah-born poet of Swedish Mormon immigrant parents, whom critic John Hollander calls “one of our few unquestionably major poets,” was within a few days of her thirty-sixth birthday when she met Pearl Schwartz. A woman of Mediterranean descent just past twenty-six, Schwartz was an attendant at a contagious disease hospital. Swenson would soon cross the threshold of a fertile creative crescent in which many of her most evocative love poems would emerge, as well as a broad variety of other work that would appear in her first book, Another Animal in 1954. Later, the two would travel by Greyhound to Utah, where Pearl met May's Mormon family. (An earlier version of this paper was presented at the first annual May Swenson Symposium at Utah State University this past June.)",

However, it was as a private citizen that Romney most exemplified the philosophy that voluntarism is not an act of charity but an act of citizenship. Romney believed that we each have a moral responsibility to be involved in organized volunteer activities to improve the well-being of the community, the nation, and the world. His efforts in founding many of the organizations that today facilitate the link between volunteers and those in need is legendary. Romney is credited as the driving force and inspiration for the 1997 Presidents' Summit for America's Future, which brought together all past U.S. presidents (held following Romney's death in 1995). This session will discuss Romney's philosophy and work in this important dimension of civil society.",

    "Presenters": "Van Hale",
    "Description": "SL04263, Based upon the theory that all authors are unique in the frequency of their use of certain words, studies of word frequencies in the Book of Mormon have been conducted to draw conclusions regarding its authorship. A number of questions have been raised. Was Solomon Spalding the author, or Sidney Rigdon, or Joseph Smith, or was it the work of multiple authors? The authors of one article assert that the statistical odds that Joseph Smith, Spalding, or Rigdon wrote the Book of Mormon are less than one in one hundred billion. However, a string of significant uncertainties exists regarding every point germane to wordprint analyses in general that undermine the very merit of Book of Mormon wordprint studies. Is it likely that an ancient author's “wordprint” could survive the original Hebrew abridgment, then translation into an unknown hieroglyphic, and then translation by a yet unsettled process (word-for-word, thought-for-thought, or some other?) into a particular nineteenth-century, grammatically flawed, American English? Did Joseph Smith play a role in word choices, or was he simply a reader? Is the range of Joseph Smith's wordprint so narrow as to exclude him as the author of or contributor to the wording of the Book of Mormon? This paper will consider these questions and more.",

Or more to the point, do they buy it? In this presentation, I explore the notion that LDS writers may have to reach beyond the LDS audience in order to grab them. Curiously, LDS filmmakers seem to be crossing over better than do the fiction writers. Analyzing the filmmakers' work can give fiction writers insights on how to write Mormon fiction that non-Mormons can stomach, which might just get Mormon writers back onto Mormon bookshelves.",

Such is the case with the rise of Mormon intellectualism and the desire among some to have it be seen as a “community” rather than a “movement.” In this presentation, I argue that debates over such things are now pointless: those who would/do oppose intellectualism's influence on Mormonism already consider it a movement and have taken measures to reduce its influence. Using a model based on studies of political processes and social movements, I highlight similarities between Mormon intellectualism and other social movements. In so doing, I intend to describe more than prescribe, but those interested in transforming Mormon intellectualism in such a way that it might take less heat will likely find profitable ideas swirling throughout the presentation.",

But since 1878, RLDS delegates to General Conferences (now “World Conferences”) have carried the obligation of debating and voting whether a document presented to the conference by the prophet is a revelation and should be added to the Doctrine and Covenants. In periods of severe controversy within the church, such as during the 1920s “Supreme Directional Control” debates and the 1980s controversy over women's ordination, a significant minority of delegates have voted against the pro-posed revelation. The recent 2004 conference had some delegates reacting negatively to a revelation (now Section 162), from the first non-Smith president/prophet, which they thought was subtly supporting the acceptance of the ministry of homosexuals. This paper will explore the difficult challenge facing RLDS delegates as they attempt to decide if a document should become part of our canon of scripture.",

By 1916, John W. and his son Lorin C. Woolley were the only ones still living of the men reportedly ordained and appointed by President Taylor.

In this session, I will share my observations about how the environment for closet doubters has changed during the past two decades. Are the “testimony” expectations still as strong? How have they changed? Are there as many closet doubters now as there were then? Are conditions in the Church better now for their “coming out” to family, friends, and leaders?

While many applaud the new emphases, others are feeling as if too much is being lost, too many traditional LDS doctrines are being deemphasized and perhaps on their way to being abandoned altogether.

    "Presenters": "David Anderson",
    "Description": "SL04352, In 1992, John Sorenson published his article “When Lehi's Party Arrived in the Land, Did They Find Others There?” Sorenson urges that they did, and that the Book of Mormon should be read as containing references to these “others” who had to have been present, but are not expressly mentioned. Indeed, Sorenson's “Others” hypothesis is now understood as a principal feature of the “Limited Tehuantepec Model” of the Book of Mormon. Under that model, the existence of these Necessary, Inferred Mayans (NIMs), is essential to the book's historicity because the early narrative events in the Land of Promise could not have occurred without them. So why are they so invisible, and voiceless? This paper critically assesses the “Others” hypothesis and identifies certain consequences it has for the Book of Mormon story.",

Brown stated that he was a Democrat because Democrats were more sensitive to the poor, he put his finger on an aspect of the gospel that many Mormons separate from their view of religion. Yet many scriptures show that compassion for the poor is central to the gospel. I contend that attitudes of Republicans and Democrats toward rich and poor help illuminate their attitudes toward many issues, such as civil rights, education, campaign finance reform, health insurance, foreign policy, the military, and the environment. It would behoove us to be sensitive to the poor as we vote in next November's elections.",

    "Presenters": "Ardis E. Parshall",
    "Description": "SL04354, The Supreme Court's 1879 ruling on the constitutionality of anti-polygamy laws triggered an offensive in the campaign to crush Mormonism. Within days of the Court's ruling, the Secretary of State notified U.S. ambassadors to seek the help of foreign governments to “check the organization of [this] criminal enterprise” by halting the work of missionaries and cutting off the supply of “recruits” emigrating to Utah “with the intent of violating [U.S.] laws and committing crimes.” While sympathetic, newspapers and governments generally labeled the Secretary's request as impractical, and the matter faded from public discussion. Unnoticed by either the press or the Church, however, the Secretary's request remained the official policy of the U.S. government throughout the 1880s. Friendly nations were prodded to follow its guidelines, and less friendly nations could carry out repressive measures knowing there would be no U.S. government interference on behalf of its Mormon citizens abroad. This paper uses state department files, newspaper accounts, and LDS mission records to examine the U.S. government's methods in pursuing the eradication of polygamy within its borders.",

These characterizations have been made by embittered former members, politicians, muckraking journalists, and a writer of wilderness and mountain-climbing books. The only people with access to the community who have come to their defense have been their Salt Lake City attorneys. Since the January 2004 excommunication of Colorado City Mayor Dan Barlow and others in what appears to be a power struggle, no one inside the community has effectively presented his or her viewpoint. I am quite familiar with these communities, considering myself sympathetic with but not uncritical of their situation and recent events. I do not claim to have all the answers but will share a number of observations, strong impressions, and historical insights into what is happening.",

Drawing on decades of research in Mormon/LDS/RLDS documents, this paper discusses patterns of doubt and resolution involving devout believers in the Restoration claims and teachings of Joseph Smith Jr. and his successors (as variously defined).

It dealt generally with the issue of the use of scripture in the church without addressing the group's specific concerns regarding the denomination's continued use of the Inspired Version, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants. In the nearly two years that followed, the task force struggled to compose a statement on these issues, and in March 2005, the group agreed that it had reached an impasse and decided to move on to the task of formulating a denominational Christology.

    "Description": "SF05032, JOSEPH SMITH AND THE GNOSTIC RESTORATION - & - MY “POSSIBLE” CATEGORY: JOSEPH SMITH'S LESSER-KNOW WIVES? The discovery of the Nag Hammadi third-century Gnostic Library has awakened interest in this very early form of Christianity. My proposal is that if Joseph Smith restored true Christianity, then it should share many similarities with Gnosticism. Indeed, there are many strong parallels between these two theologies, starting with a shared sense that humans are saved by intimate knowledge of God and that the eternal unity of the sexes is necessary for “exaltation.” Further, this historical record shows us that churches run by the spirit will be brought under control by hierarchy. - - - - - - - - - - - - - When I was writing In Sacred Loneliness: The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith, I had to decide which women could be safely documented as authentic wives of Joseph Smith.

For a year and a half, from January 21, 1854 to June 21, 1855, she resided in San Francisco. During that time, she probably recorded more detail about the branch of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which flourished there than did all other extant sources combined. This includes social interaction as well as the regular church meetings, and probably no Mormon visited there during her residence in the city without being noted in her diary. This paper draws from this most insightful document to convey a detailed picture of the branch and its people during that time.",

How do we view the various attempts by others, including church leaders and prophets through the ages, to communicate this central message? The second essay focuses on the “concept” of the atonement. What is it that an explanation of the atonement is trying to explain?

In short, the creationist and postmodern science studies communities are hardly recommended as allies to LDS scholarship.

It dealt generally with the issue of the use of scripture in the church without addressing the group's specific concerns regarding the denomination's continued use of the Inspired Version, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants. In the nearly two years that followed, the task force struggled to compose a statement on these issues, and in March 2005, the group agreed that it had reached an impasse and decided to move on to the task of formulating a denominational Christology. In this presentation, task force member Andrew Shelton will speak about the conclusions the task force has reached regarding Restoration scripture, and preview the group's coming work on Christology, which he hopes will eventually help the denomination better address the issue of scripture.",

McConkie's Mormon Doctrine (very authoritarian but not “authorized”), and the procedures and policies in the Church Handbook of Instructions (not generally available to members). Although aimed specifically at “youth, young single adults, and new converts,” it for the first time makes available a source upon which members can draw with complete reliance that “this is what we believe.” This paper samples some entries from this under-advertised but significant work in the context of other behavioral handbooks now available. -- & -- The Proclamation on the Family is now 10 years old. It has been widely promulgated and heavily promoted in official church literature. Decorative copies adorn church building walls and the walls of devout Mormon family homes.

Indeed, there are many strong parallels between these two theologies, starting with a shared sense that humans are saved by intimate knowledge of God and that the eternal unity of the sexes is necessary for “exaltation.” Further, this historical record shows us that churches run by the spirit will be brought under control by hierarchy. - - - - - - - - - - - - - When I was writing In Sacred Loneliness: The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith, I had to decide which women could be safely documented as authentic wives of Joseph Smith.

For a year and a half, from January 21, 1854 to June 21, 1855, she resided in San Francisco. During that time, she probably recorded more detail about the branch of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which flourished there than did all other extant sources combined. This includes social interaction as well as the regular church meetings, and probably no Mormon visited there during her residence in the city without being noted in her diary. This paper draws from this most insightful document to convey a detailed picture of the branch and its people during that time.",

One part of this session will look at what creates spirituality in music and it will also look at how varied music we define as spiritual can be, from towering peaks of Western classical music to hymns, spirituals, Broadway musicals, rock songs and protest music, including the Gospel according to Peter, Paul, and Mary. This session will combine talk, analysis, music, audience participation, and a live performance by singer-songwriter and itinerant biotechnologist Glenn Cornett. Caveat emptor: Mr. Cornett holds strong to the conviction that a culture that cannot laugh at itself has not achieved a proper level of maturity.",

Both patterns can be temporary, decades-long, or lifelong. Both involve the mind, the spirit, and the emotions. Drawing on decades of research in Mormon / LDS / RLDS documents, this paper discusses patterns of doubt and resolution involving devout believers in the Restoration claims and teachings of Joseph Smith Jr. and his successors (as variously defined). The paper then compares those findings with scholarly studies of patterns of doubt and resolution among Christians generally. As time allows, audience members will be invited to comment, from their own experiences and observations, on the accuracy or applicability of my personal findings and those separate findings by Christian scholars.",

    "Title": "Tracking The Sincere Believer: 'Authentic' Religion And The Enduring Legacy Of Joseph Smith, Jr.",
    "Presenters": "Laurie Maffly-Kipp, Jan Shipps",
    "Description": "SL05091, Who was the real Joseph Smith, Jr.? Over the past two centuries, he has been portrayed as a great spiritual leader, a prophet, a religious charlatan, and a deeply unstable person. Was he a divine conduit or a mountebank? A caring leader or crafty seducer? Biographers and believers continuously have sought the “real” man beneath the sacred self-descriptions. In this lecture, Laurie Maffly-Kipp suggests that this quest tells us much more about ourselves and our own times than it does about Smith. For believers and nonbelievers, determining Joseph Smith's sincerity is a mighty business. For Mormons, Smith's honesty directly correlates to the honesty of the Latter-day Saint tradition. If Smith really met Moroni, then the basis of Mormonism is confirmed; to distrust Smith's sincerity is to distrust the entire faith system. Likewise, among nonbelievers, doubting Smith's veracity is a key component of their debunking. Regardless of their theological commitments, then, believers and nonbelievers share an obsession with sincerity. Did Joseph Smith mean what he said? Did he feel religious inside? These questions necessarily tempt a far more fundamental query: What is sincere about religion? Moreover, once we move beyond the sincerity polygraph, what remains of Mormonism, and of religious belief more generally? What will we see, about the Mormon faith, about religious sincerity, and about ourselves, if we begin to move beyond this obsession with authenticity?",

McKay inherited a church that was provincial and backward looking. His immediate predecessors wore beards and came from polygamous families, two powerful symbols that were out of touch with modernism. . . . Clean-shaven, immaculately dressed, and movie-star handsome, McKay immediately caught the attention of member and non-member alike, and held it. He democratized Mormonism, . . . [adjusting] the relationship between church and member. . . . He emphasized the paramount importance of free agency and individual expression, for he understood that improvement of the parts would inevitably improve the whole. “Let them conform” was replaced by “Let them grow.” He willingly discarded institutional uniformity for the higher goal of individual excellence. He pitched a wide tent and then told members of all stripes that he welcomed them to join him and build the church within it. In this plenary presentation, Prince will focus on President McKay's leadership within the context of two forms of revelation. He will discuss the first form, “internal” revelatory processes, through the story of the various ways President McKay wrestled with the problems facing the Church because of its policy of withholding priesthood and temple blessings from black members. He will address the second form, “external” processes, in the context of the growth and development of the international church.

Proceeding through a series of inspiring experiences and baffling incidents as a graduate student, young professor, and college dean in North Carolina, South Carolina, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Utah, he held many leadership positions in branches, wards, and stakes. Never church-broke,” however, he challenged the conservative status quo all along the way, enjoying a few notable successes but more often precipitating humorous results.

Proceeding through a series of inspiring experiences and baffling incidents as a graduate student, young professor, and college dean in North Carolina, South Carolina, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Utah, he held many leadership positions in branches, wards, and stakes. Never “church-broke,” however, he challenged the conservative status quo all along the way, enjoying a few notable successes but more often precipitating humorous results. He traces the evolution of his religiosity to his current way station, where he describes his spirituality as peacefully independent of the Mormon Church.",

    "Description": "SW06001, New York Doll is a film that captures one of those rare occasions where life is not only stranger but also better than fiction. As the founding member of the visionary rock group The New York Dolls, Arthur “Killer” Kane belonged to a select group of musicians widely credited as the definitive proto-glam-punk ensemble. The Dolls pioneered a look and sound that paved the way for the punk and glam rock Dolls look-alikes who would follow in the next decade. Unfortunately, like many other bands, the Dolls crashed and burned amidst a flurry of drug and alcohol abuse. Fast forward thirty years, and find 55-year-old Arthur riding the bus to his job at the LDS Family History Center Library in Los Angeles. Arthur had converted to Mormonism in 1989 after answering an ad in Reader’s Digest. He’s somewhat content but still dreaming of reuniting with the Dolls and returning to life as a musician. Enter Greg Whiteley, a filmmaker and member of Arthur’s ward, who believes Arthur’s life story would make a wonderful short documentary and begins interviewing him. As they are moving ahead with this project, they learn that Morrissey, the legendary former lead singer of The Smiths and a huge fan of the Dolls, would like to have the band reunite for a huge music festival in London he is organizing. This breaking news, combined with the fact that Whiteley’s interviews with Arthur were beginning to “look like a film,” emboldens the filmmaker to envision his modest project more ambitiously. What had initially begun as a short profile of Arthur’s strange journey from rock god to lost soul to LDS Family History worker was becoming a bigger idea. The final film, New York Doll, is an 76-minute documentary that has excited audiences at festivals, including the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, and in theatrical release. The film features interviews about the Dolls and Arthur with rock legends Morrissey, Bob Geldolf, Chrissie Hynde, Mick Jones, Iggy Pop, and others. It also features interviews with Arthur’s friends at the Family History Library (who pitch in to help Arthur get his guitars out of hock so he can begin practicing for the reunion) and depicts many poignant moments leading up to Arthur’s reunion with the other surviving members of the Dolls and their triumphant comeback at the 2004 Meltdown Festival.",

He began at Claremont an eager academic; he left with a deep cynicism toward intellectual life. He began at Claremont with a deep love for Germany (having served his LDS mission to Germany only eight years earlier); after teaching with many Jewish-German emigres, he left with a distrust for Germany.

Its approach is unabashedly political in nature. Its purpose is to show how cultural representations in human life serve to reinforce power structures that marginalize some and centralize others. Once marginalized but now centralized in the American culture, Mormonism is a very interesting case study for this type of critique. I believe we can learn much about Mormonism's relationship to networks of American power through reflection on the ultra-positive representations of Mormons in pop culture.

These challenges, generally, the skepticism of outsiders and the faith-promoting interests of members, serve as a microcosm of some of the questions of method and audience which loom large for a non-Mormon just starting out in the field. The interpretive problems that beset the academic study of religion, issues of faith and scholarship, of the status of insiders and outsiders, of the parochialism that religion tends to bring out in scholars as much as in everyone else, are displayed in particularly stark relief with respect to the study of Mormonism, and are significant challenges to a student looking for a voice and audience within the evolving discipline.",

My new book, Victim of the Muses (see WWW.HUP.HARVARD.EDU/CATALOG/COMVIC.HTML), looks at the origins of poetics in western civilization in this perspective. The poet as prophet, Marsyas, Aesop, or Socrates, grotesquely ugly and a warrior with words, was often offensive to sophic society and became the pharmakos, or scapegoat, killed or cast out by political leaders.

What is the relationship between history and faith, and is Mormonism and the faith of its members tied more closely to the historical record than they are in most other traditions? How should Latter-day Saints react when elements of their “sacred story” are challenged by new historical perspectives?

    "Presenters": "Anne Wilde, Mary Batchelor, Richard Dutcher and Doe Daughtrey",
    "Description": "SW06011, BIG LOVE, BIG ISSUES The new HBO series, Big Love, has created quite a stir among media watchers, cultural critics, and Mormons. Why the buzz? The show centers on the family of Bill Hendrickson, the owner of a growing chain of home improvement stores who owns three homes of his own, each occupied by one of his wives and their children. HBO is known for producing series that explore unusual families (The Sopranos, Six Feet Under) but suburban polygamy? The family's lifestyle is informed by Mormonism. In the second episode, it is revealed that at age fourteen, Bill, like other young men, was cast out of the fundamentalist Mormon polygamous community in which he was raised because senior leaders didn’t want competition for younger wives. And they practice religious devotions such as personal prayer, grace at meals, and spiritual blessings. But they are not portrayed as Mormons nor even as typical fundamentalists. They don't attend church nor wear temple garments, and only one family member, second wife Nikki (whose father is the prophet/leader of the community that ostracized Bill),dresses anything like what one usually associates with fundamentalist Mormon women. Still, the show is set in Utah with Mormon references popping up everywhere, a prayer in which Bill expresses gratitude for their being a family sealed for 'time and all eternity,' casual references to Relief Society, Young Women's, Mormon bishops, teen slang terms such as 'Morg' and 'Morbot' for super-devout LDS, the local high school's name and mascot: the 'Cumorah Cougars.' Given its uncomfortable history with its polygamist past and the great lengths the LDS Church has gone to in order to distinguish today's Mormonism from its nineteenth-century incarnation, LDS leaders are quite uncomfortable with the series, urging producers to place disclaimers in the credits and issuing statements to the press and local Mormon leaders clarifying the current LDS stance toward the practice of polygamy. In contrast, however, some Latter-day Saints are quietly pleased that Big Love has come along because it is forcing a fresh discussion of polygamy and the difficult balancing act Church leaders have tried to perform this past century of renouncing the practice while never denouncing the doctrine of plural marriage. In this session, we're pleased to have the opportunity to talk about the series and the issues it raises. How many families like the Hendricksons live in the United States today? How accurate are the series' portrayals of the joys and trials of plural families? What might the fallout, both positive and negative, be for the LDS Church should the series become a hit and genuine player in America's culture wars?",

While many political theologies are often either positive or negative toward involvement, LDS doctrine seems to have characteristics of both. In this paper, I compare Joseph Smith's teachings with Jacob Taubes's “radical” reading of St. Paul. Taubes, a Jewish philosopher, argues that Paul's Epistle to the Romans expresses a negative political theology. Building on Richard Lloyd Anderson's argument that Paul and Smith have much in common, I use Taubes's perspectives as a tool for identifying aspects of negative political theology in LDS teachings which, despite appearances to the contrary, seem to underlie and, in a sense, override the better-known and more frequently quoted aspects of positive political theology.",

Now I teach religious studies' students at Utah Valley State College, and I find that many of these students who share the passion I had for religious studies are the very ones who are leaving the Church. In this session, I will share some of their feelings (gathered through personal interviews) and contrast them with my own personal faith journey. Kimball- Boyd Petersen and I became friends sixteen years ago when we both lived near Washington D.C. I was experiencing a crisis of faith, and Boyd served as a much-needed sounding board. Through the ensuing years, Boyd's presence in my life provided a bandage for my wounded and bleeding faith, allowing me to feel connected to the Church even while doubting. Still, not until I was introduced to James Fowler's Stages of Faith some seven years later did I feel permission to fully expose my wounds, to truly face the loss of my faith altogether, so they could actually heal. Fowler's work and my mentoring friend gave me the tools I needed to find a meaningful place within my tradition.",

    "Description": "SW06018, William Lobdell’s 16 February 2006 Los Angeles Times story is the latest in a string of stories over the past four years in which journalists have focused public attention on how DNA research on Amerindian ancestry has impacted discussions of Book of Mormon historicity. Until now, the impact of these stories on typical Mormon discourse has been minimal. Perhaps it was the front-page placement of Lobdell’s story, perhaps it was the tug of the human stories it told of Native American and Polynesian Latter-day Saints who had once thought they were Lamanites and now are not so sure, or perhaps it is simply that multiple exposures to the issue are now having a cumulative effect, but it seems that this latest story has begun to reach the ears of and unsettle more Latter-day Saints than ever before. (One evidence for this is the Church’s adding links on its official website, www.lds.org, to seven additional and often more aggressive and speculative responses to the DNA studies than the four it has had links to for the past several years.) In this session, we welcome William Lobdell who will share with us the story of how he came to write this article as well as about his experiences in its wake. We are also excited to hear from other panelists who will help catch us up on the science of DNA and the recent findings that are generating the discussion and how they are being employed by both critics and apologists, provide an overview of the history and politics of “Lamanite identity,” and present fresh perspectives on the relationship between science and human meaning-making. Where does the discussion of Book of Mormon historicity currently stand? Is a major paradigm shift for understanding this foundation scripture on the immediate horizon? If so, what might it look like?",

In the course of his presentation, Phil and attendees examine Mormon cultural “mantras,” the repetitive phrases and ideas that help organize the internal lives of many Latter-day Saints.

A common feature of academic scholarship written on Mormonism has been to highlight its unique theology in which God the Father not only possesses a physical body but we, as his children, have the potential to progress and become as he is: Gods and Goddesses. Some of these scholars have used this as an opportunity to classify Mormonism as being a polytheistic religion. Not only does such a classification misrepresent Mormonism, its worship practices and beliefs, the polytheistic label also dislocates the religion from its socio-historical context and presents it as a religion more akin to paganism than Christianity.",

    "Description": "SL06091, Religion and Pop Culture: Shotgun Wedding, Marriage of Convenience, or Match Made in Heaven? We've come a long way since Hollywood's idea of religion was confined to biblical sand-and-sword operas; Irish priests and chaplains with twinkly eyes; and morally corrupt Protestant evangelists like Elmer Gantry. Barely a month passes without a movie or television show that portrays people of faith, often in a favorable light. By the same token, Christian creators of alternative culture have come a long way from showing Billy Graham studio movies in church basements; producing feel-good, uplifting television dramas for the Sunday morning broadcast ghetto; or publishing treacly books that sell only because they are “Christian.” Popular culture has experienced a seismic shift in the past two decades, thanks in part to the global market economy. Commercial producers now recognize that evangelical Christians constitute a lucrative, discrete market that will respond if the product appeals to them. And sophisticated evangelicals have learned that if their production values are equal to the marketplace, their movies, TV shows, music, books, radio stations, and stand-up comics can enable them to protect their constituency from the toxic popular culture. As an unintended consequence, the best of their creations can provide effective outreach for the unchurched. Join celebrated religion writer and astute media observer Mark Pinsky for a fascinating tour through this shifting terrain as he explores what lies ahead. Is this just a blip, or is there a fundamental change in American popular culture, one that integrates faith and religion as part of the landscape? Will ensemble television comedies and dramas now have “the Christian” as a stock character, the way many now have “the gay character”? If Christian movie producers like Walden, or commercial studios, produce a string of high-budget bombs at the box office, will this trend come to a screeching halt? With at least one comic book hero, a Mormon named “Cypher” from the New Mutants, and the incredible success of Napoleon Dynamite, will LDS characters go mainstream? It's worked that way before for evangelical Protestants. Ned Flanders, Homer Simpson's goofy next door neighbor, put a human and humorous face on evangelicals for people whose only previous exposure was to dour, cable TV gasbags. Although skeptical at first, church youth workers on college campuses found that young Christians had recognized in Ned a kindred spirit and had adopted him as a lovable mascot. At least one prominent Protestant mega-church pastor likes to wear a “Vote for Pedro” T-shirt. Mark I. Pinsky's journalism career began in the 1960s at Duke University, where he wrote a column called “The Readable Radical” for the campus daily. After graduation, he worked for several underground papers before heading to Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism and respectability by earning his M.S.J. Mark spent most of the 1970s in the Southeast as a free lance writer, primarily covering racial and criminal justice trials and focusing on the death penalty for outlets like the New York Times. After living and working in China in 1982-83, his first regular, full-time job came in 1985, staff writer for the Los Angeles Times' Orange County Edition. At the Times, he wrote about religion, the performing arts and philanthropy and, again, courts and criminal justice. Mark became religion writer and senior reporter at the Orlando Sentinel in 1995, specializing in coverage of evangelical Christianity in the Sun Belt.",

But what about the man in the midst of this flurry of activity? In his March 1987 Sunstone reflection, son Edward L. Kimball suggested that several personal characteristics animated his father's service as Church president: he loved to interact with people; he had a sense of humor; he had a feeling of personal insignificance or inadequacy; he tried harder than anyone else.

    "Description": "SL06123, Truth-Telling And Mormonism This session features two reflections on the issue of Mormon truth-telling. Scot Denhalter's presentation focuses on the musings of Princeton moral philosopher Henry G. Frankfurt about a quality of misrepresentation that falls on the continuum between telling the truth and lying (somewhere just short of a lie), which he names “bullshit.” Denhalter asks if this type of discourse exists in Mormon culture and, if so, to what extent? Is there a different type of it in Mormonism than is found elsewhere? Does the Church employ social mechanisms that increase or decrease the incidence of “b.s.” in Mormon culture? Ryan Wimmer explores a religious principle, taqiyah, that Shi'a Muslims use as a means to protect their faith. Taqiyah means to “safeguard or defend” as well as “to fear” (as in the sense of being pious) and allows members of the faith to be untruthful when their life or religious faith is in danger. Wimmer argues that a similar principle exists in Mormonism, though it's unnamed and has yet to achieve a recognized status as an aid to faith. He asks, “Should it?”",

Wotherspoon speaks of his own sustained immersion in liminality and talks of a community that is created by like-minded searchers. But, by definition, can liminality be sustained? Is it more likely that someone born into Mormonism will be a liminalist longer than would a convert, especially in evaluating the truth claims of the faith? Is this related to the processes involved in resolving inner conflicts? What role does courage play in the conclusions one comes to?

Kimball's highly anticipated study of the landmark Church presidency of Spencer W. Kimball arrived late last year with far less fanfare than it deserved. According to the book's preface, the author and publisher Deseret Book “[did] not agree on the interpretations or weight of importance given to a number of events or the choices of characterizations of some of the people” in the book. Although disagreements and compromises are part of every author/publisher interaction, the inclusion of this statement has led to considerable speculation about the limited marketing campaign the book has enjoyed, as well as about what wild statements might be lurking in more extensively footnoted version of the book on the CD-Rom packaged with it.",

    "Description": "SL06191, Screening Of New York Doll And Discussion With Director Greg Whiteley New York Doll is a film that captures one of those rare occasions where life is not only stranger but also better than fiction. As the founding member of the visionary rock group The New York Dolls, Arthur “Killer” Kane belonged to a select group of musicians widely credited as the definitive proto-glam-punk ensemble. The Dolls pioneered a look and sound that paved the way for the punk and glam rock Dolls look-alikes who would follow in the next decade. Unfortunately, like many other bands, the Dolls crashed and burned amidst a flurry of drug and alcohol abuse. Fast forward thirty years, and find 55-year-old Arthur riding the bus to his job at the LDS Family History Center Library in Los Angeles. Arthur had converted to Mormonism in 1989 after answering an ad in TV Guide. His life is calmer, but he still dreams of reuniting with the Dolls and returning to life as a musician. Enter Greg Whiteley, a filmmaker and member of Arthur's ward, who believes Arthur's life story would make a wonderful short documentary and begins interviewing him. As they are moving ahead with this project, they learn that Morrissey, the legendary former lead singer of The Smiths and a huge fan of the Dolls, would like to have the band reunite for a huge music festival in London he is organizing. This breaking news, combined with the fact that Whiteley's interviews with Arthur were beginning to “look like a film,” emboldens the filmmaker to envision his modest project more ambitiously. What had initially begun as a short profile of Arthur's strange journey from rock god to lost soul to LDS Family History worker was becoming a bigger idea. The completed film, New York Doll, is a 76-minute documentary that has excited audiences at festivals, including the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, and in theatrical release. The film features interviews about the Dolls and Arthur with rock legends Morrissey, Bob Geldolf, Chrissie Hynde, Mick Jones, Iggy Pop, and others. It also features interviews with Arthur's friends at the Family History Library (who pitch in to help Arthur get his guitars out of hock so he can begin practicing for the reunion). The film depicts many poignant moments leading up to Arthur's reunion with the other surviving members of the Dolls and their triumphant comeback at the 2004 Meltdown Festival.",

Can gender difference and equality coexist? (2) Can equality be measured objectively? Are there certain criteria we should look for? Do we find them in the Church? Or is equality a subjective matter? If LDS women feel equal, is that sufficient? (3) Does the Church have the moral duty to promote equality within its organization?

Regarding doctrine, Joseph Smith saw the Church and the Latter-day Saints themselves in the stage of infancy. According to him, there is a vast reservoir of religious knowledge available to any who ask and seek and are prepared to receive. Given Smith's many declarations, why don't we see more diversity among today's Latter-day Saints?",

The Dilemma For Mormon Artists And Whether There's A Way Out Why do so many Mormon artists find themselves torn between the Church and their art, feeling that they're leading two very different lives that are difficult to reconcile? Why do so many of us feel that we have to make a choice between being loyal to their Church and loyal to their art? Is it simply that, as the Bible suggests, “No man can serve to masters, for either he will hate the one and despise the other, or he will hold to the one and despise the other”? Is Art a master that challenges faith and God? Or is it more complicated than that? Orson F. Whitney suggested that Mormonism would “yet have Miltons and Shakespeares of our own” and for years people have been talking about the “Great Mormon Novel” being just on the horizon. Yet is it really possible for a great artist to exist within a religious structure such as Mormonism? Brian Evenson will talk about the pressures he experienced when his first book, Altmann's Tongue, cost him his job at Brigham Young University, and the path he followed from feeling that he could personally reconcile his art and his faith to being put in a position where he felt like he had to make a choice between the two. Are there ways of thinking about the relation between faith and art that will allow us not to compromise either, that can allow for a symbiotic relationship that a religious structure can not only understand but encourage?

To understand Church responses to this crisis, I analyzed all general conference talks and Improvement Era and Ensign articles on gender from 1940 to 2006. They show the Church harshly criticizing change, then accommodating it without really changing, and finally creating a new boundary between itself and its social environment. By stressing the positive aspects of its difference with contemporary society, the Church convinced members to adhere to doctrines that might otherwise have resulted in a loss of authority.",

My new book, Victim of the Muses, looks at the origins of poetics in western civilization from this perspective.

The show centers on the family of Bill Hendrickson, the owner of a growing chain of home-improvement stores who owns three homes of his own, each occupied by one of his wives and their children. HBO is known for producing series that explore unusual families (The Sopranos, Six Feet Under). But suburban polygamy? Given its uncomfortable history with its polygamist past and the great lengths the Church has gone to in order to distinguish today's Mormonism from its nineteenth-century incarnation, LDS leaders have been less than comfortable with the series, urging producers to place disclaimers in the credits and issuing statements to the press and local Mormon leaders clarifying the current LDS stance toward the practice of polygamy. In contrast, however, some Latter-day Saints are quietly pleased that Big Love has come along because it is forcing a fresh discussion of polygamy and the difficult balancing act Church leaders have tried to perform over the past century of renouncing the practice while never denouncing the doctrine of plural marriage. In this session, panelists will talk about the series and the issues it raises. How many families like the Hendricksons live in the United States today? How accurate are the series’ portrayals of the joys and trials of plural families? What might the fallout, both positive and negative, be for the LDS Church now that the series has become a hit and will be a player in America's culture wars?",

Because of the theological significance of Romans in Christian history and the nature of Joseph's edits, this part of his biblical revision is of a different sort than other, more expansive portions such as the Book of Moses. Although Joseph's method, the actual correcting of the Bible text, was characteristically idiosyncratic, it certainly wasn't without analogues, particularly in the context of growing nineteenth-century doubts about scriptural purity and worries about the pitfalls of translation. How does Joseph's work fit in with these worries and other attempts to answer theological questions by making adjustments to scripture?",

He was poet in residence for several years in BYU's English Department. Though he never joined the LDS Church, he got along famously with and mentored many of his Mormon colleagues, students, and neighbors. Hear what his friends have to say about this anomalous figure whose influence in the world of Mormon literature will be felt for generations. This session is part of a larger project to commemorate Leslie Norris through short personal essays, to be published on the Mormon arts blogspot “A Motley Vision” and in the Mormon literary journal Irreantum.",

    "Description": "SL06271, Dissenting Opinions: Art From The Dark Side Of Happy Valley Mormon teachings depict the universe as driven by a plan, a plotline in which good will assuredly triumph over evil. Humans are believed to be essentially divine beings who will ultimately respond in accord with their truest nature. Given this framework, Mormons (like most people) generally prefer their art to reflect this optimism, to reinforce cherished notions and values. Yet in Brian Evenson and Neil LaBute, Mormonism has at least partially given birth to artists who have deliberately chosen to create stories that don't pan out the way they're supposed to, in which heroes don't win out and villains often walk in the world unmolested. Or worse, artists who in many cases refuse to identify any moral framework or make any ethical judgment on the actions of their characters. What are these artists thinking? How can they defend their choices to show unrepentant and unredeemed selfishness, delusion, obsession, violence, and cruelty? In filmmaker Richard Dutcher, one finds another LDS artist whose films, though certainly depicting a brighter ethical universe, often portray Mormon characters with deep flaws who don't always come around, a storyteller willing to shine a light on problems and the ragged edges of too-easy answers. What happens when LDS artists stretch boundaries? Why do they do it? What do we learn about ourselves as individuals and a culture in the ways we react to their work?",

More than twenty films have emerged since then, some produced to have crossover appeal (e.g., The Other Side of Heaven and Dutcher's films, including his newest, States of Grace), others unabashedly insular, relying on Mormon in-humor and banking on LDS religiosity (e.g., The Singles Ward, The R.M., Day of Defense).

Bengt finally gave up on his painting/art teaching career after reading about Congo the Chimp, a prolific painting monkey with “art” in galleries, museums, and private collections all over the globe. After nine years of toil, his bank account and résumé© were inferior to those of a trained monkey. Since switching to comedy, Bengt has performed in comedy clubs and on college campuses all over the United States. In 2001, he won the prestigious San Francisco International Comedy Competition, and just this past year was invited to perform at the very cool Vancouver International Comedy Festival.

What is more dangerous is that it jolted one of Clifton Jolley's children, his eldest daughter, who called him seeking explanation. A father's instinct to defend his daughter against the evils of DNA research seduced Jolley out of his retirement from Mormonism to investigate and explain the pragmatics and polemics of DNA research as a commentary on the heritage of the Lamanite remnant in the Americas.

How are we to explain this and several other subtle echoes of Mormonism in Hitchcock’s final movie? Based on research at the Hitchcock archives, as well as interviews with the film’s assistant director, sound editor, and Patricia Hitchcock (Alfred’s daughter), this presentation argues that the passages are an important element in interpreting Hitchcock’s final movie, and that Family Plot offers an implicit commentary on Mormonism as well.",

    "Presenters": "Rick Jepson and Becky Johns",
    "Description": "SL06362, We’re all familiar with the humorous aspects of Mormonspeak. But it has a negative side in the way that it frequently leads us to slip into conventional patterns that discourage thought and encourage conformity. By selecting active, precise, and living language, we can force ourselves to question our assumptions, challenge our faith, and ultimately elevate our testimonies. This session explores the encroachment of institutional language into our faith expressions. It also includes several group exercises, including experiments with E-prime, a conventional form of English that forbids use of any conjugated form of the verb “to be.” Let’s see what a little experimenting can accomplish with common testimony phrases such as, “I know the Church is true,” if we can’t use the word “is”!",

Phelps. Since Smith dictated both letters, the rhythms recoverable are the rhythms of his speech and represent a voice as distinctly American as Walt Whitman's.",

    "Title": "Peculiarities",
    "Presenters": "Eric Samuelsen",
    "Description": "Sunstone is thrilled to host the world premiere of a new film, Peculiarities. Initially written by Brigham Young University professor Eric Samuelsen as a play, the film version has emerged as a true cooperative venture by the writer, director, crew, and cast, who have all worked on the film for free. Of Peculiarities’s origins, Samuelsen says: Ever since I began teaching at BYU in 1992, I’ve become a bemused student of Mormon culture, intrigued by its idiosyncrasies and oddities and inconsistencies. Every so often, my observations have resulted in plays: Gadianton, The Way We’re Wired, Without Romance, and others. peculiarities is the result of conversations I’ve had with the LDS young people I teach and interact with. Mormon culture tends to preach a “letter of the law” approach to moral questions, and especially in regards to issues of sexual morality. And so I became aware of some of the peculiar ways in which moral rigidity and sexuality collide in our culture. It occurred to me that combining all these stories and practices into a single play might make for a compelling evening in the theatre. I was especially taken with the idea of presenting this material naturalistically, simply showing the stories of these flawed human characters without apology, explanation, or mediation, presuming a morally centered audience and allowing that audience the space to reach their own conclusions about the issues raised by these stories. And so, sometime around 1999, I wrote Peculiarities. The film features six separate stories, exploring difficult topics not to glorify poor decisions nor to make fun of the moral attitudes and inconsistencies that lead the characters to make those decisions, but to illustrate and better understand their consequences. Noted LDS storyteller Orson Scott Card says, “Mormons can no more live by empty, meaningless art that pretends to be moral because it is devoid of any relation to reality than the rest of the world can live by art that scoffs at morality and presents a view of life as a meaningless, pointless, undirected accident.” Peculiarities strives to be moral art that is at the same time effective as art.",

We got a sense of the wide variety of his passions and interests in the short “Sunstone Gallery” feature in the January 2002 Sunstone. But what do we really know about Ardean Watts? Friends, it's time for the full load! Join us for a delightful tour of a colorful, musical, and extraordinarily joyful life. After proper cajoling, this maestro has graciously agreed to take up the baton (we mean remote control) and conduct us on a pictoral, personally narrated and properly soundtracked trip through events and people, ideas and loves that animate this most animated of lives. Ardean will lead us through everything from beginnings and mission to Utah symphony, opera, and arts, environmental, and peace activism; from university teaching to church service and his own form of “course correction”; from family and friends to birding and mushrooms, including travels on four continents. And, as anyone who knows Ardean might expect, the touch will be light and the emphasis, irreverent!

In this workshop, JOHN DEHLIN discusses “middle way” strategies for maintaining Church involvement even when one is feeling out of the mainstream of Mormon life and belief.

    "Description": "SL07091, SMITH-PETTIT LECTURE- THE MAKING OF THE MORMONS, OR MY FOUR YEARS AS A STRANGER IN THE STRANGE LAND OF MORMONISM The spiritual landscape is my instinctive journalistic beat. I am drawn to radical spiritual commitments, and so naturally, Latter-day Saints interest me. For me, making documentaries is an elaborate creative and spiritual project, one of balancing and layering, of crawling inside the revelation of another religion. I will outline the complicated process of making The Mormons and illustrate it with behind-thescenes stories and guiding strategies that will, I hope, help us better understand the never-ending dance Mormonism has with the media, and vice versa. I will detail my preparation process, including the challenge of persuading PBS to commission a documentary on Mormons, and the overwhelming tasks of understanding Mormonism, of gaining access, reading stacks of books and articles, interviewing hundreds of experts and lay folk, many of whom first had to get permission to talk to me. For The Mormons, I wanted to create a thematic work, not a chronological history. Our challenge was to determine what are the defining events, ideas of Mormonism? How can we describe some, but not all, of Mormonism's big bold ideas without getting lost in a theology lesson? How might we tell some, but not all, of the history and not get lost in a chronological swamp of names and events? How might we establish balance when examining the truth claims of Mormonism without either endorsing/selling the religion or subjecting it to inappropriate attack? We interviewed some 1,000 people before we began filming. Our primary challenge then was to find the right personal mini-dramas and especially people who speak without deadening piety or platitudes. Then there was the search for images! How might we visually suggest the shockingly literal nature of Mormonism but not allow the film's metaphors to be taken literally? Finally, I will speak about the response of non-Mormons to the documentary and what these reactions tell us about the relationship between Mormons and mainstream America. I will also share what surprised me most in making this documentary, personally and professionally.",

Is this silence inspired by jealousy over the fact that the Community of Christ owns the grave, or does it arise from deeper motivations? In this illustrated essay, I follow the tortuous history of Joseph Smith's bones, secret burials, exhumations, family feuds, and even the speculation that Smith has already been resurrected.

One might watch this film and see Kane as being redeemed by his conversion, as given meaning by his job at the family history center, and as rewarded by the reunion of the New York Dolls at the Morrissey Meltdown festival. This is too simplistic. Kane's nostalgia for his former life as a raunchy rock star is apparent from the opening of the film and not indicative of a simple LDS conversion story. Kane's bishop's advice about reconciling with his former bandmates and his ward members' help to retrieve his pawned guitars bring together two worlds usually rent apart. The atonement between these communities is the theology of the film, a theology reflected in audience reactions as much as in the film itself.",

    "Description": "SL07125, THE RELIGIOUS CONSTRUCTION OF ETHNIC IDENTITY: THE CASE OF THE MORMONS Mormonism is an intriguing case in which an “ethnicity” of sorts was constructed from the ground up using a unique theological system and the common cultural stories. In the course of constructing their religion, Mormons began to see themselves as special descendants meant to congregate together on chosen land, and they believed that they shared a common bloodline heretofore unknown to them. I explore the religious rhetoric that created a people, the common experiences that strengthened that identity, the factors that diminished it in the last century, and how that identity now affects the way Mormons act and are perceived in the world today.",

    "Description": "SL07126, 'FOR THE HUSBAND IS THE HEAD OF HIS WIFE THE WAY CHRIST IS THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH': WHAT WAY IS THAT? When most people read Ephesians 5:23, “For the husband is the head of his wife the way Christ is the head of the Church,” they cannot help but understand “head” to mean “ruler,” “leader,” or some other form of “authority over.” And since Latter-day Saints believe the Bible to be the “word of God, as far as it is translated correctly,” that means the husband's the boss, right? In fact, “authority over” is not a correct translation of kephale (head). I will show that instead of mandating hierarchy in marriage, Paul actually is instructing husbands to behave in such a way that they grow in unity and love with their wives. I will also explore the implications of this simile for how the church should be “headed.”",

The Mormons will certainly be one of the tradition's primary public faces for many years to come. How well-suited is it for this role? What themes and strengths in the film should someone hope will become forefronted in future discussions of Mormonism? What might one prefer remain more in the background?

Both ideologies look forward to the abolition of government and the building of a socialist society based on free association and cooperation. Attempting to argue such a case seems perplexing, given the generally pro-capitalist, pro-government, pro-war stance of many American Mormons. Such attitudes exist despite resources within Mormon scripture advocating the contrary, and sadly lead to Mormon support for militarism, imperialism, and economic and other kinds of exploitation. It is important that Latter-day Saints do not see the establishment of capitalism as the end of history, but rather actively strive to establish a society and economic system in accordance with the principles contained in their own sacred writings.",

This situation has led many Latter-day Saints to interpret Book of Mormon Trinitarian language in light of current doctrine—a project that yields unsatisfying results. A key to interpreting the Book of Mormon’s theology of God is in Ethan Smith’s A Treatise on the Character of Jesus Christ, and on the Trinity in Unity of the Godhead (1814). The treatise offers fascinating insights for those of us who have never found explanations of the Book of Mormon’s views on the Godhead to make much sense.",

Polls revealing in some cases that a third or more potential voters would have strong hesitations in voting for a Mormon candidate have caught many Latter-day Saints off guard. Is Mormonism still such a lightning rod, still so associated with the claims of cultishness, still so misunderstood in terms of its current versus past practices and teachings so as to elicit this kind of a priori rejection of a candidate simply because of his faith tradition? This panel of careful and astute Mormon-watchers from backgrounds in different fields and from both without and within the LDS church wrestles with Mormonism's present and speculates about its future courtesy of this “Mitt moment.” How will his Mormon faith affect his run for the Republican nomination?

Conversely, what effects will his officeseeking and very public profile have upon Mormonism? What will come as LDS doctrines past and present are lifted up for examination in the public arena?

Are there demographic or ideological biases in the bloggernacle? Are certain groups excluded, women, or gays, or even conservatives? Can the bloggernacle really represent mainstream Mormonism while also providing an accurate window into the many different demographic and ideological subgroups within the Mormon community? Should it even try to? Join a panel of bloggers and blogwatchers to discuss these and related issues. Moderator JOHN FOWLES is an attorney now living with his wife and three children in London, England. He has co-operated with his brother the LDS-themed blog A Bird's Eye View (HTTP://ABEV.WORDPRESS.COM) since July 2004. Currently, John also blogs at Mormon Mentality (MORMONMENTALITY.ORG).",

When one's faith tradition is as all-encompassing as is the LDS church, even more opportunities for being or feeling betrayed arise as expectations about certain behaviors or priorities are very often met by a jarringly different reality. In this session, panelists who are contributors to or are familiar with the book, Shattered: Six Steps from Betrayal to Recovery, by Fay A. Klingler and Bettyanne Bruin, will discuss steps that are helpful in leading one through the emotional trauma and bitterness that come with various betrayals, freeing one to move forward with a happy and fulfilling life.",

The volume contains sixteen essays on different expressions of the Latter Day Saint movement that have emerged since Joseph Smith Jr. organized the Church of Christ in 1830. Among those included in the volume are groups who trace their path through Sidney Rigdon, James J. Strang, Alpheus Cutler or Granville Hedrick. Also included are historic (no longer extent) branches of the movement that were led by David Whitmer, William Smith and Amasa Lyman. Finally the volume outlines the history of fundamentalist Mormonism and recent schisms within the Reorganized Latter Day Saint tradition",

The underlying dividing issue is what constitutes the “sure word of God.” Marcus Borg frames the different perceptions of God's Word in an “earlier” and “emerging” paradigm. Using Borg'smodel, I suggest that what is happening in the Episcopal Church is also occurring in the LDS church, though quieter and with less drama. The “schism” is between those who are certain the LDS Church has God's final word and those who are less certain but still find a spiritual edification within the psychological and sociological framework of the institution.",

Many proposals call for some combination of investigation, apology, and monetary compensation to slave descendants. As a Mormon and a reparations advocate, I'm in a no-man's-land. Colleagues who support reparations have negative views of the Church, and Church friends are skeptical of the idea of reparations. Both sides can learn from each other. For example, reparations scholarship can draw on the history of Mormon claims for redress. Similarly, there are many reasons, based on Mormon doctrine, culture, and history, why Latter-day Saints should support slavery reparations. In this 150th anniversary year of the Mountain Meadows Massacre, we need to think seriously about concepts such as group harm, restitution, atonement, and reconciliation. Slavery reparations provides a good lens for this examination.",

Gnosticism and shamanism practice techniques of “knowing”, entering spiritual dimensions and experiencing the ineffable, both heavenly and hellish. Derivative forms of these ancient traditions were practiced in upstate New York during Joseph Smith's formative years. Interestingly, shamans and Gnostics used certain psychotropic plants and fungi during rituals and ceremonies to facilitate trance states. Used in this setting, psychoactive substances are often called “entheogen,” meaning to manifest “God within.” I will review the use of entheogens in shamanic and Gnostic traditions and the evidence that puts Joseph Smith in proximity to their use. It will also show how the use of entheogens can reproduce many of the paranormal and mythmaking abilities Joseph manifested.",

But a remarkable answer to prayer, “This is the restored gospel and you are to join,” led him to put aside his strong aversion to the then- current policies and trust in God's goodness. The answer he received was so powerful that it has provided the grounding for his testimony ever since. And it had to be powerful to sustain him through the many challenges he has been called to go through in a life of service that has allowed him to advocate firsthand with prophets and apostles on issues affecting black Saints. Please join us for a wide-ranging interview with this remarkable Latter-day Saint, who, though not naturally blessed with patience with trials of body or promises delayed, still affirms that his life is “blessed,” that “God is in charge.”",

(1) The Joseph Campbell story structure always starts with a hero who must find an “elixir” to heal either an ailing community or him/herself, an elixir that can be found only outside the community, both spatially and ideologically. Claiming to be the only true church and unable to apostatize, the LDS church often sees such journeys as a threat. (2) These stories skip from a first act (the set-up) to a third act (the resolution), leaving out the second act: struggle. By leaving out this second act, institutionally told stories suggest there is no need to wrestle with angels or argue with God because the proper resolution of our struggles has been determined. We argue that we should embrace the challenge to “work out our own salvation” as an invitation to play God's fools.",

I look at the status of spiritual experience as the ground of commitment for one's life, its epistemic status and its spiritual significance. I argue that attacks claiming that such experiences are not trustworthy because they are merely ephemeral emotions are based on a caricature and unjustified reduction. In the hands of evangelicals, these critiques are self-refuting, incoherent, and contrary to scripture. The same attack from a secular perspective is also unjustifiably reductive and selfdefeating, but for different reasons. Religious experiences entail both cognitive and affective dimensions that, when synergistically joined, are a sound basis of commitment.There is a peculiar genius and beauty in religious commitment that is won by God one heart at a time.",

    "Description": "SL07271, DOES GOD REALLY HATE AMPUTEES?, OR WHAT DOES SCIENCE AND REASON TELL US ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF GOD? The title of this panel discussion comes from a website discussed by atheist Sam Harris in his book, Letter to A Christian Nation, that insists that there are no “answered” prayers that could not be written off as coincidence. Despite all of the healings from sickness or close calls averted, he says, God never, ever, heals an amputee, no matter how many people are praying it (and despite biblical promises that whatever is asked in faith can be received). Harris's book (as well as his lengthier The End of Faith), and Richard Dawkins's, The God Delusion, have become extremely popular, arguing intelligently from the position of science, human suffering, and biblical problems that there is almost certainly no supreme being or personal deity. Aside from the conviction of personal testimony, can science and reason be usedjust as convincingly for the existence of God? How might believers respond just as intelligently to the newly popular atheist movement? Are there aspects of these discussions that Latter-day Saints, in particular, might contribute to?",

However, years of hard-fought activism have effectively reduced the stigma of homosexuality in our culture. The result is a new generation of selfactualized, productive queer men and women. This panel will feature men and women with a Mormon upbringing who have thoughtfully embraced authentic gay lives.

In this session, we will discuss whether the rise of this new technology will foster a renaissance of Mormon literary work and second blossoming of Mormon literature.",

Following Jerald's death this past October, Sandra has continued to operate the ministry.

Particularly suggestive is our ability, publicized by Oxford geneticist Bryan Sykes's Seven Daughters of Eve, to track mitochondrial DNA mutations to European “clan mothers”, and beyond them to African ancestresses. Traditionally overshadowed by male surname-conferring bloodlines, our matrilineal pedigree remains a vital influence on identity. This essay, an introduction to a work of creative nonfiction, examines how my own engagement with five hundred years and twelve generations of Germanic foremothers connects me to my genetic past, and to twelve long-lived North Friesian women, in ways likely to elude a genealogist focused on baptizing deceased relations. “Matrilineal genealogy” pays tribute to the women, named at the bottom of our pedigree charts, who publish their history in our genes.",

I examine evidence showing that, contrary to Smith's practice and shortly after his murder, LDS women were denied continued participation in the highest quorum of the church, were no longer anointed priestesses unto God, and were deprived of the Relief Society as a female priesthood organization. I explore how these blows to women's claim to priesthood theologically resulted in the vitiation of the doctrine of the fullness of the priesthood as the basis for the Quorum of the Twelve's claim to succeed Joseph Smith as successor, as well as the negative impact that the denial of priesthood fulness to women has had on the LDS church and the male priesthood contingent.",

Since the first publication of the Book of Mormon, Mormons have covenanted with American Indians and Polynesians that they are the Lamanites. Recently, however, many Book of Mormon apologists have been cowed by evidence that American Indians are not trans-oceanic Israelites but descendants of Asiatic peoples, and as a result,have begun to retreat from traditional claims. But the Book of Mormon remnant are not so quick to surrender their birthright. Tribes such as the Havasupai have declined to participate in the National Geographic DNA definition of their history and religion. If Mormons are able to deny our paternalistic policies rather than betray our promises, if we can receive the example of indigenous peoples' loyal to their myths rather than vainly attempting to reconcile our historical faith with contemporary science, we may yet discover a better response to genome research by being carried in the arms and upon the shoulders of the Lamanites.",

Perhaps fewer members would feel “betrayed” by the Church when they encounter troubling information after being in the Church for years without being taught about discrepencies. But were the Church to more proactively engage in “information inoculation,” would so doing better serve faith and spiritual growth? What should the role of the Church as an institution be in doing this versus that of LDS independent and apologist groups?

If there is a contemporary contribution to be offered by the Restoration movement, it cannot rest on ludicrous claims to “all truth” or prophetic inerrancy. But the Romney campaign does unwittingly provide an opportunity to sift through the church's heritage in search of values and understandings that are credible in the broader culture of American society.

In December 2006, in an Irish rare book shop, I found a key to interpreting the Book of Mormon’s theology of God in Ethan Smith’s A Treatise on the Character of Jesus Christ, and on the Trinity in Unity of the Godhead (1814). The treatise offers fascinating insights for those of us who have devoted years of study to Joseph Smith’s narrative but have never found explanations for its views on the Godhead to make much sense.",

Critics of the Book of Mormon argue that it is unrealistic to believe that following four centuries of internecine conflict and violent struggle, peoples as warlike as the Nephites and Lamanites could have had two centuries of peace. The Book of Mormon itself provides the most convincing evidence that such peace is attainable. This paper examines the conditions that led up to that long season of peace and explores the reasons why so many generations refused to go to war. Finally, it attempts to draw parallels between Nephite history before, during, and after the coming of Christ to the New World and what is currently happening in the Valley of the Euphrates and how, at the beginning of the 21st century, we can begin shaping the peace that seems so essential.",

    "Description": "SW07007, Divided Loyalties? Mitt Romney: The First Mormon President? In many ways, Mitt Romney is a dream candidate for Mormons: he is handsome, bright, charismatic, and articulate. He has been a successful businessman and politician as well as Church leader. He has a quintessential Mormon pedigree, polygamous ancestors; distinguished genealogy; son of a prominent political, business, and Church leader; ideal family man. In many ways, he seems like a general authority. And yet, a number of Mormons are disquieted by what they see as Romney's reshaping himself from a moderate to a far right conservative, one more at home with the extreme edge of the Republican Party and Fundamentalist Christian Coalition than with the American Mainstream. How do Mormons with ambiguous or even negative feelings about Romney deal with their loyalty to the Church and the prospect of having a fellow Mormon in the White House? How do Romney supporters justify his seeming political shape-shifting? What would a Romney presidency look like, and what would it mean for the Church?",

Given that science and technology are among the most obvious manifestations of active faith in the future (fighting disease, improving communications, cleaning environments, extending life spans), how might we promote the application of science and technology to a Mormon view of the future and bring them into dialogue with the plan of salvation?

This high-profile film covers everything from Church origins, scripture, persecution, exodus, and nineteenth-century controversies to today's mainstreaming and emphases on families, missions, patriotism, and image, and how those play out in the lives of contemporary Latter-day Saints, both those who fit within the ideal and those who don't. We are thrilled to have Helen Whitney join us for this session of clips from this and others of her films (The Monastery; John Paul II; Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero) and conversation with the audience about her experiences with “the Mormons”, the film and the Latter-day Saints and commentators she's met during this journey over the past five years, which included visits to several Sunstone symposiums, Mormon History Association conferences, and many other LDS gatherings.

My research illustrates that there may be little difference between a 'liberal' Mormon and an ex-Mormon in terms of knowledge of difficult historical, doctrinal, and cultural issues.

Originally, however, these were denigrations used to describe the unsophisticated country dwellers who had not yet accepted the tenets of Christianity then normative among city dwellers. This paper will suggest that 'paganism' in this sense of the term should now apply to the scriptural literalism that is still existent today and which is decidedly more common among people who dwell in rural or other less-densely-populated areas. In this context, I ask whether Mormonism might be one of the more intransigently pagan cultures in the U.S. and indeed the developed world.",

Dr. Roof received his B.A. in English (magna cum laude) from Wofford College, followed by an M.Div. from Yale University, and then an M.A. and Ph.D., both in sociology, from the University of North Carolina. In addition to his teaching duties at UCSB, he is the principal investigator for a Ford Foundation-funded project on religious pluralism in southern California and recently completed an academic director stint for a U.S. Department of State project, 'Religion in the United States: Pluralism and Public Presence.' Among the sixteen books he's written, edited, co-authored or co-edited, two are particularly relevant for this year's Smith-Pettit lecture topic on generational spirituality: Spiritual Marketplace: Baby Boomers and the Remaking of American Religion (Princeton University Press, 1999) and Bridging Divided Worlds: Generational Cultures in Congregations He is married to Terry Roof, a writer, educator, grief counselor, and advocate in the California juvenile court system. We all belong to a generation, whether conscious of it or not. Generations are age-based cohorts who share somewhat similar life experiences: They have grown up influenced by common national and international events; their outlook and values were shaped in their formative years by the social environments of which they were and still are a part. Religiously, there is an important impact, and often subtle. Broad social and cultural changes, especially in the role of the media and shifts in work and family patterns, all bear upon how we see ourselves and our understandings of faith, spirituality, God, and social issues important to us. In this presentation, we shall look at four generations-World War II Generation, Baby Boomers, Generation Xers, and Millennials -and profile their differing religious and spiritual views, the challenges each has or has had in making sense of their lives, and their lived expressions of faith. As we shall see, the fundamental question 'Who Am I?' turns out to be far more complex that we might have first imagined.",

Then he cautiously told us almost nothing about it. Later prophets have been even less help, unwilling to venture even so far as an opinion of whether there is progression between the kingdoms. So, although Mormons know more about heaven than do other Christians, it's not much more than what is postulated by Islam, and not enough better to encourage suicide. Dr. Jolley's tautology fills in the gaps, creating aversion of heaven inspired by Mark Twain, Pogo, and (perhaps least of all) the prophets.",

A Freudian Approach to The Sugar Beet Latter-day Saints are conventionally and stereotypically portrayed as inhabiting a G-rated culture that valorizes domesticity, obedience, and chastity. For this reason, and the fact that many Mormons enthusiastically embrace the stereotypes, the humor of The Sugar Beet is particularly interesting. In its treatment of issues concerning sexuality, gender, and authority, The Sugar Beet has opened or at least laid bare, another level of Mormon culture that is much more complex than that assumed in the stereotypes. But what makes Mormon humor, humorous? To explore this question, I turn to the work of Sigmund Freud who argues that jokes have two primary functions: aggression and exposure. In analyzing several jokes from The Sugar Beet, I will probe whether Freud's framework helps us to understand the underlying dynamics of Mormon humor. The presentation will be interactive, with audience members being invited at times to reflect upon what is (and is not) humorous about a particular joke.",

He ends his essay with the title question: 'Did he know himself?' Since the good professor is not now available to us (we tried!), I propose to discuss his question with an emphasis on how the rising generation might respond to it.

The Group started as an informal organization, partially the brainchild of Gerald and Carol Lynn Pearson, but was soon so successful that it was incorporated into local Church structure.

Carl Jung developed a model for the growth of the psyche that he named 'individuation.' Jung asserts that the unconscious leads us to health and growth.

Of course, if we attend to our dreams, we may understand signals the unconscious gives us regarding our relationship to authority systems. I present examples of dreams analyzed through Eugene Kovalenko's CREEI process. Dream analysis can be a viable method of coping with religious conflict.

Unwavering obedience to leaders (including the notion that even if leaders make mistakes, we are blessed by obeying them anyway) tends to foster an unhealthy culture of hero worship and a view of General Authorities as celebrities, resulting in our being distracted from the central figure of the Savior and sometimes promoting a mentality that leads to abuses of power.",

Contrary to the view among many that the scriptures are paradoxical and inconsistent, and therefore adaptable to essentially all U.S. declarations of war, we believe that a more critical and comprehensive reading of latter-day scripture reveals a clear, powerful, and consistent framework wherein we are invited to 'renounce war[s] and proclaim peace' (D&C 98:16). In particular, scriptural narratives about war and peace are quite clear if Christ's teachings, life, and death are allowed to serve as the prism through which they are interpreted, understood, and followed.",

Church leaders frame political issues as moral causes and call for support. Church public relations must explain the distinctions between mainstream Mormonism and splinter groups making headlines. Church involvement in political issues can cause ripples and tensions overseas. How does the Church redirect or appropriate the media scrutiny directed at it? What are the consequences of heightened media scrutiny, and how does the Church respond? How does it handle unintended consequences of its efforts or decisions?",

But in a politically and economically globalized world, religion must revisit what counts as moral and expand the scope of its obligations to address contemporary problems. In many ways, Mormonism has restricted its moral canon to include traditional values while dismissing contemporary moral issues as 'political.' In this panel, young Mormons will present a case for five moral issues frequently politicized by the contemporary Church-war, torture, environmentalism, capitalism, and dissent-arguing for their inclusion in the moral canon and discussing ways in which leaders can inspire positive change in the membership.",

If this is true, that would mean there would be 400 victims of Smith's debauchery. Ironically, the historical record fails to identify even one woman who said she was seduced by the Prophet. An in-depth review of available historical documents reveals a total of nineteen claims accusing Joseph Smith of sexual impropriety. In this session, I evaluate these claims for believability, emphasizing the difference between rumor, assumption, and credible evidence. I present extensive research that supports the probable existence of conjugal relations between Joseph Smith and nine of his plural wives, possible existence with another six, and doubtful existence with all non-wives and 'polyandrous' wives.",

The talk evoked both strong feelings and deep contemplation, and even now, nearly a year later, it still garners discussion as LDS women and men have used it as a springboard to reflect on their personal experiences of knowing in terms of parenthood, perfection, nurturing, and scriptural interpretation. One diverse group of women used the energy of the discussion to develop a website, WhatWomenKnow.org, designed to expand the conversation about what it means to be an LDS woman. Panel members in this session will do a brief readers' theater performance that illustrates the process of the site's evolution.

However, Mormon theology, particularly as advocated by Joseph Smith near the end of his life, diverges from tradition to posit emergent gods that organize worlds from existing matter according to existing laws. Aiming at justifying Mormon theology, we have formulated a new argument for God's existence. The argument is based on assumptions widely shared among both secular andreligious persons, is consistent with modern science and technological trends, and concludes that we should trust that our world probably is created by advanced life forms more benevolent than we are. We invite philosophers, theologians, scientists, technologists, and anyone interested in such matters to come with your most critical eyes and ears.

I argue that how someone assesses the evidence for and against Book of Mormon historicity is fundamentally a question of how well socialized that person is into the Church.

The panelists will evaluate this proposition, relying on their personal experience with the Church outside the United States and addressing the question whether some revered customs and traditions might be downplayed or dispensed with altogether in countries beyond the United States.",

Although the Godbeites eventually dissolved as a practicing faith. the ethereal connection between spiritualism and Mormonism lingers on.

Shaken Faith Syndrome: Strengthening One's Testimony in the Face of Criticism and Doubt Using very selective presentations of the evidence, many groups target Mormons in the hope of creating doubt and disillusionment. And sometimes they succeed, as many Latter-day Saints are unaware that faith-shaking claims have been addressed time and again. A new book by Michael R. Ash, Shaken Faith Syndrome: Strengthening One's Testimony in the Face of Criticism and Doubt, examines the underlying misconceptions that contribute to de-conversion, suggests ways Latter-day Saints can strengthen their intellectual foundations against challenging issues, and then provides an even-handed and accurate framing of several of the most popular LDS-critical arguments. How well does it succeed? Would this book be a valuable tool for you or a loved one? Please join the book's author and a panel of careful readers in a vigorous exchange about this book and the important topic with which it wrestles.",

The story is told from the perspective of Ethan, a college-aged, gay Mormon, who shortly after the death of his father, begins to crave intimacy with his best (and married) friend, which sets him on a somewhat desperate and impulsive soul-searching path of sexual and religious identity. In the process, Ethan reveals the complex nature of his dilemma: the integrity of his faith and his love for Mormonism (and all that its theology of eternal marriage implies), and his genuine need for human affection.",

Neither approach accounts for the content of Mormon authoritative texts that demonstrate that Joseph did not abandon, but rather complicated, his earlier teachings, leading to misunderstandings of his most controversial religious contributions. My paper seeks to promote for rising generations a spiritually unified interpretation that accounts for and gives equal dignity to the source texts of Joseph Smith's complex godhead doctrine.",

Since Joseph Smith's First Vision is both the fundamental historical event and the basic theological tenet of Mormon thought, it has been the object of many attacks on Smith's credibility. Questions are generally raised concerning the content and the timing of the event because Joseph did not report on the event until more than twelve years after it occurred. Lucy Mack Smith, Joseph's mother, added to the problem by merging the First Vision and the 1823 visitation of the Angel Moroni to the Prophet in her history, which was prepared after Joseph's death and not subject to his review. This presentation addresses the timing and content issues through a careful analysis of the sequence of events that led up to the First Vision.

    "Description": "In 2008, the Pew Forum released the US Religious Landscape survey, the largest study of American religious life ever conducted, including a statistically significant sample of Latter-day Saints. What does it tell us about Mormons and other religious groups in America? This presentation will focus on three areas, with a particular focus on the Mormons: (1) current religious make-up of the nation, including demographic differences between religions, (2) differences between members of different religions in terms of beliefs and practices (3) social and political attitudes of religious groups. The presentation will also include a special examination of Mormonism, including differences between converts and lifelong members, as well as between Mormons living in Utah and Mormons living in other states.",

    "Presenters": "CARRIE MILES",
    "Description": "Some women attempting to escape from polygamy have complained that LDS bishops they consulted advised them to return to their husbands because “We are all going to have to live polygamy someday.” LDS theology distinguishes between “higher” laws--what God really wants us to do--and “lower” laws, which we have to settle for because the higher law cannot be practiced under current earthly circumstances. Despite the Church’s opposition to its contemporary practice, plural marriage continues to be viewed as the higher law that will be practiced in heaven. Comparing Old Testament examples of polygamy (and my experience with polygamy in Africa today) with New Testament teachings about marriage raises the question, however: Is plural marriage really a higher law after all?",

I examine the ascendancy of Obedience Culture among LDS and other US religious communities and explore its recent extension into public policy. I argue that Obedience Culture influences have deteriorated America’s moral leadership and that the particularly organized LDS strain was decisive in passing Proposition 8 against same-sex marriage in California. I conclude by suggesting a course of action for engaging the greater LDS community, with the hope of a more thoughtful and favorable role.",

Conservative Mormons responded that in Joseph Smith's time, young teen brides were common. This paper will review the American history of family life to answer the question: what was the normal marriage age in Joseph smith's culture? Were marriages to 14-, 15-, and 16-year-old teens common in 19th Century New England, the culture that nurtured the early Mormon Church?",

This paper traces public and private anti-miscegenation statements made by early Church leaders, including Joseph Smith–from expressions of disgust and horror bolstered by scriptural proof-texting and prophetic language to shore up its theological foundations, to 20th Century political accusations of a joint “negro” and Communist conspiracy to bring societal and moral upheaval to the United states.",

    "Presenters": "Ben Clarke",
    "Description": "Paper 1: \"A Marginal Moses: A Case Study in Canonicity, Historicity, and Revelation.\" Since its canonization in 1880, most LDS members have viewed the Book of Moses as a restoration of lost truth grounded in historical events. However, converging lines of evidence from Mormon history, the reevaluation of the Joseph smith Translation, and textual criticism of both the Hebrew Bible and restoration scriptures have undermined this assumption, creating an increasingly marginal place for the Book of Moses in the LDS canon. The need to reevaluate the paradigm used to understand the Book of Moses creates difficult questions and promising possibilities for the discussion of historicity, methodology, and canonical status for LDS leaders, scholars, and members.  Paper 2: \"The Myth of the Missing Book of Abraham Papyrus.\" The \"missing papyrus theory\" has gained ground as the most popular Book of Abraham apologetic. Defenders of this theory have exaggerated the quantity of papyrus that is missing from the present collection—and in so doing, have hindered the progress of serious historical understanding of the origins and meaning of the Book of Abraham. When eyewitness testimony and physical evidence are examined through responsible historical methodologies, we find not only that the corpus of missing papyrus is much smaller than has been claimed, but also that the ostensible source of the Book of Abraham is among the extant fragments.",

    "Description": "Mormon polygamy (sometimes called “big love”) might have roots in Hebrew writings; however, Mormon Celestial Marriage was first alluded to in the Book of Mormon and was later shared with 200 men and more than 700 women in Nauvoo, Illinois, between 1841 and 1846. at first practiced in silence because it was against Illinois law, Nauvoo polygamy was disrupted by an internal revolt which resulted in the arrest and assassination of the Mormon prophet and expulsion of the saints from Illinois. Polygamy was first announced in the salt lake valley in 1852, but was never retroactively included in the adumbrated history of Nauvoo. When the U.s. government pressured the saints to end plural marriage circa 1890, a process of institutional forgetting ensued. More than a century later, the HBO series Big Love portrays family life in modern polygamous households, while those men who pioneered the early practice of Celestial Marriage in Nauvoo are still inaccurately depicted in Church instruction manuals as having had only one wife. Come hear more about the intricate and lesser-known history of Celestial Marriage in Nauvoo",

In doing this, we hope to not only delve into specific issues of Mormon feminism, but also to illustrate the variety of approaches available for future work in the area.",

    "Description": "This panel will discuss why contemporary Mormon women have such strong feelings about this topic, how it defines the beginning of our journeys as mothers, how it might reflect LDS dependence on male authority figures in our decision-making, and the diminishing importance of midwifery roles within the LDS community from the early pioneer days when they were held in such spiritual esteem.",

    "Presenters": "Holly Welker",
    "Description": "Produced by BYU in 1969, the short film Johnny Lingo is often cited as a wise, compassionate story of male sensitivity to female identity, a positive demonstration of how to foster female self-worth. But the story hinges on the idea that a woman’s self-esteem is based on the price she commands in a financial transaction between men, not on any internal sense of who she is. This paper will present a close reading of the film, examine some implications of this financial transaction, and consider more realistic and modern ways than the barter system of encouraging female self-respect.",

Pyle told the public he wanted “to protect the lives and futures of 263 children” in a community “dedicated to the production of white slaves.” The raid was an expensive failure and cost Pyle his office. In April 2008, Schleicher County, Texas authorities raided the 1700-acre YFZ Ranch and seized 439 FLDS children with almost identical justification and results. Both raids played to the same stereotypes, drove the FLDS inward, and were financial disasters for the states. Didn’t anybody read history?",

    "Description": "For mainstream Latter-day Saints to foul up occasionally on doctrinal questions is no big deal. We all do it. But when a questionable teaching originates from the Church’s top leaders, it becomes a larger problem. That’s because in today’s Church, we tend to treat concepts as true merely because they come from the prophet, First Presidency, or Twelve. Ere long, the dubious doctrines or teachings creep into manuals, magazines, classes, and talks, and we’re stuck with them. In this session, I will explore twelve questionable teachings that have been propounded by top Church leaders and have been widely believed. By examining them, perhaps we can magnify our capacity to detect and weed out other dubious teachings.",

The Mormon doctrine of divine embodiment requires that Mormon theologians go further. Our teaching that God the Father is an embodied male who is the literal father of our spirits requires that a heavenly mother exist, but is she a member of the Godhead?

Fortunately, there is a large growth industry whose mission is to provide aids for Bible study. Unfortunately, many are sectarian and intend to persuade rather than to enlighten.

Texts of scripture provide divine guidance and inspired insight for life when responsibly interpreted and faithfully applied. However, texts must be read, overheard, and absorbed so that lives lived might be both formed and transformed by the witness of scripture. This can happen in the act of proclamation. What will be proclaimed is a word about and through the main character, Tamar, David's daughter who is raped by her brother Amnon.In this powerful text, many of the controlling issues of patriarchy and the subjection of women, which severely limit the options women can exercise, are exposed. The implications of this text for women in church and culture are immense. Here is a text of terror that has the potential of lancing our comfort and complicity with things as they are and our inclinations to suppress what is just by not rocking the boat.",

This paper will compare the 2006 CHI with its 1999 counterpart, especially modifications and changes. It will also explore the larger context of hierarch and member in which, presumably, most of the active roles are assigned to the hierarch and most of the passive roles to the member.

    "Presenters": "Kevin Cantera",
    "Description": "In 1894, John Hyrum Koyle began digging the Dream Mine on a mountaintop in central Utah. Koyle, who was a Mormon bishop at the time, claimed he had been shown where to dig by Moroni, the same heavenly messenger who had led Mormon founder Joseph Smith to unearth the golden plates. Moroni visited Koyle in a dream and showed him nine enormous caverns inside the mountain containing countless piles of gold. Moroni told Koyle that the gold would remain hidden in the caves until an unspecified time preceding the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. At that moment of chaos, Koyle and his followers would unearth the gold and it would support the financially-troubled LDS Church through the Last Days. This paper investigates the nature of belief in the Dream Mine, which remains fervent more than one hundred years later. Although shareholders’ dreams are perpetually deferred, believers tap into a rich vein of folklore that runs through Mormon cosmology. This presentation will consider how Dream Mine belief has evolved in a changing economic, political, and religious landscape and demonstrate that the faithful find sustenance in the Mormon past while simultaneously embracing modern worldviews that extend beyond mainstream Mormonism.",

However, despite the “constructedness” of these historical restorations, these fabrications have real effects.

What attracted him to the new movement? What qualified him to become the public face of Mormonism so early?

    "Description": "In April 1984, RLDS Church President Dr. Wallace B. Smith presented to the church’s World Conference a proposed revelation which, among other things, called for the church to begin ordaining women. The issue had been festering in the church for at least fifteen years and was very controversial. Approximately twenty percent of the delegates voted against the motion to accept the document as a revelation to be included in the Doctrine and Covenants, and approximately the same percentage of active members ceased their involvement in the church as a result. It was a watershed moment in the history of the RLDS Church (since 2001 the Community of Christ), and the church today is in some ways difficult to recognize compared to the church that existed a generation ago.

This paper will explain why the early Mormon mainstream did not initially buy into the anti-cross polemics that typically came from American Protestants during the time that the Church was organized. Additionally, I will illuminate how and why the cross aversion later came about.",

Do exalted women feel inferior to exalted men? Is polygamy demeaning to women or a benefit available only to females, a benefit that comprises a minor component of the eternal patriarchal order?

Knowledge is a boon rather than a curse; the fall is fortunate rather than fatal; and Eve is a hero rather than a pariah.

What are the benefits (or hazards) of having an author's religious beliefs inform their work or spill outright onto the page?",

    "Description": "Mormon Studies is a field of growing academic interest, and many young LDS scholars are making it their professional focus as well as a personal interest. This panel brings some of the bright young minds in Mormon Studies together to discuss what drew them to this field of study, what kinds of academic work they are doing, what Mormon topics are generating interest in the academic world, what stereotypes they have encountered doing work in this field, and what if any impact their academic study has on their own religious/spiritual life? And what of those who are teaching and mentoring LDS graduate students? We'll hear from them, too.",

This session includes a discussion of the implications of Dr. Ryan's research for Latter-day Saint families",
